T_Dialog_Dialog_@There's only two days to go until the day Senpai said he would reward me... but I can't take it any longer... 
T_Dialog_Dialog__1@Now that I'm stuck in another world... all alone...\nI have yet to find a way back to Valkyria... What do I do... Somebody, please tell me...
T_Dialog_Dialog__2@All the girls on TV look so dazzling... unlike me, who has always been ignored... and treated like air...
T_Dialog_Dialog__3@Hmm... that man always brings me delicious taiyaki. I should bring him a gift later too...\nLuna is so considerate! Don't forget to shower Luna in praise!
T_Dialog_Dialog__4@Oh yeah, that's right! I found a wonderful gift in the trash can just then~\nHehe~ I'll put it on his pillow so he can see it the moment he wakes up~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1000101@Darkness alliance, thank you for studying darkness magic so laboriously over the years!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1000102@But this is far from enough. I want your... souls... or your heart!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1000103@Whoa!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1000104@Oh ooh……
T_Dialog_Dialog_1000105@Oh you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_1000106@Huh? Wait...
T_Dialog_Dialog_100101@Oh, is this an attempt to buy me off?  Just kidding... I'll take it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_100102@Coach's cut! I'll collect it well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_100103@No...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_100104@Wah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_100105@Wait...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_100106@Haa... Over there...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1100101@Well well... It’s so nice to receive the attention of a man like a young girl again~
T_Dialog_Dialog_1100102@It’s been so long since I received a gift like this... My heart is beating so quickly~
T_Dialog_Dialog_1100103@Ahhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1200101@Is this... for me? It looks pretty useful. Thank you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_1200102@Are you... pursuing me? Ah~ Sorry! I definitely misunderstood it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_1200104@What...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1200105@It feels... strange...
T_Dialog_Dialog_1200106@This is...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1300101@I like anything that Senpai give me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1300102@Senpai... Thank you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1300103@Senpai... What's this...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1300104@Senpai... No...
T_Dialog_Dialog_1300105@Senpai... It feels... weird...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1300106@Senpai... Stop toying with me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_1400101@Aah~ Thank you... my dear Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_1400102@Ah~ I'm so flattered...
T_Dialog_Dialog_1400103@Ah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_1400104@It hurts...
T_Dialog_Dialog_1400105@Please... stop it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_200101@Coach's gift?  Hey, hey~ Thank you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_200102@This gift... seems a little different from those we get from fans…
T_Dialog_Dialog_200104@Ah, ah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_200105@Hey— Where...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_200106@Well... Stop…
T_Dialog_Dialog_300101@Your regard... I will treasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_300102@This is something I like... When I get this from you, I feel all warm and fuzzy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_300105@Stop...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_400101@Hey, hey... Saki  is so happy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_400102@Saki, too! Saki  also wants  to gift Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_400103@Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_400104@Saki  hates that…
T_Dialog_Dialog_400105@Saki  knows I'm wrong…
T_Dialog_Dialog_400106@Stop  there…
T_Dialog_Dialog_500101@Gift~?  Thank you... But where can I put it in the room?
T_Dialog_Dialog_500102@I wish it could be a soft pillow~
T_Dialog_Dialog_500103@Well~ It's a bit numb…
T_Dialog_Dialog_500104@It hurts…
T_Dialog_Dialog_500105@Well... Don't do that…
T_Dialog_Dialog_500106@There... there... It feels strange…
T_Dialog_Dialog_600101@What, do you think this kind of thing can buy me off?
T_Dialog_Dialog_600102@...Well, I'd like to thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_600103@What is this?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_600104@Ooh... This kind of thing…
T_Dialog_Dialog_600105@Well... Don't get drunk off success!
T_Dialog_Dialog_600106@Wait until it is over...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_700101@Thank you... Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_700102@Next time, I'll do something for you, coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_700104@Ah... It's a little…
T_Dialog_Dialog_700106@That kind of place…
T_Dialog_Dialog_800101@What? What?!  Give me something special... I...! ...Thank you…
T_Dialog_Dialog_800102@I'm not happy! But since you've given me this, I'll just accept it…
T_Dialog_Dialog_800103@I can't forgive you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_800104@What is this?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_800105@You lied to me...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_800106@You're...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_900101@A present? Why did you give me this...? I (I don't understand)...
T_Dialog_Dialog_900102@This is... It’s something that men and women give to each other...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_900103@What…!?
T_Dialog_Dialog_900104@Eh…! Damn it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_900105@This thing...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_900106@Grrr... This is part of training too...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E000_1_1@Coach! I just saw someone from another team doping! Go report her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E000_1_2@You... I'll report what you're doing if you keep your hands on me like this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E000_1_3@Coach! Someone asked for a duel with you! What do we do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E000_1_4@Umm, does it mean a compliment when Coach pats me on my head? Is that so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E000_1_5@The birds are also cheering for Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E000_1_6@Do you know that if a Coach of a team treats Alicia to a drink before a match, his team will have a much better chance to win! Now you know what to do, don't you~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E001_1_1@Hehe... Coach, look! There's a huge hole on the back of your pants~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E001_1_2@What? I didn't do that! Am I that kind of person?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E001_1_3@Oh ho~ I didn't expect you to be bold like this~\nBut if it's you, I might as well grant you a chance to touch me more~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E001_1_4@The sun is brutal out here... I need some shade...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E001_1_5@No Go, Coach! No Go, Coach!...\nHmm? My cheering didn't sound right? How can that be~ There must be something wrong with your ears!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E001_1_6@You still don't believe me? Your reaction makes me sooo sad!! (pretentious sobbing)
T_Dialog_Dialog_E002_1_1@This is the sports drink I just made by myself. Coach, would you like some?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E002_1_2@Should any of the members feel unwell, please ask them to come to me. My herbal ointment can ease the illness and refresh them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E002_1_3@Hm? It's not working? I'll have to check if I missed any ingredient...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E002_1_4@Do-Don't do that... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E002_1_5@Coaching is definitely not an easy job. Please don't forget to get some rest from time to time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E002_1_6@Lavender essence can ease your stress and nerves. Coach, would you like to try it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E003_1_1@With me cheering right here, Coach will never lose!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E003_1_2@Why do you keep bothering me? Aren't you afraid of me getting mad?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E003_1_3@I told you I had already prepared all of them... Huh? Why are they all gone? Unbelievable!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E003_1_4@It might look like I'm always idling around, but the fact is that I've already done everything needed. I'm always thinking ahead of all the other fangirls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E003_1_5@Are you done touching me... Shouldn't you be taking care of your members?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E003_1_6@How can my evaluation go wrong? I'm demanding a reevaluation!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E004_1_1@D-Do you think that my outfit is weird? But, I'm already used to wearing this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E004_1_2@Everyday outfit? \nI'm definitely going to look horrendous... I think it's better if I don't...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E004_1_3@I've serviced many customers before, but I still can't quite fix my shy personality...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E004_1_4@Um... My family didn't force me. I wanted to help out of my own accord. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_E004_1_5@If Coach is interested, feel free to come visit me at my club... If you can choose me to service you, it'll make me even happier...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E004_1_6@I originally came to promote my club, but I'm glad that I could have such a nice talk with Coach! \nI'm glad that I could meet you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E007_1_1@Hmph hmph~ You probably won’t find anyone better than me~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E007_1_2@Little ideas, inpirations and general knowledge - I write them all in this notebook. \nJust a peek and you’ll get that I’m a genius~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E007_1_3@Research shows that more and more people only get off on adult works, what a headache~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E007_1_4@Ancient alchemy is actually pretty interesting, I included it in my research. \nMaybe there will be a way to replicate it in the future?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E007_1_5@I’ll be working late in the lab today. Is anything the matter?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E007_1_6@You would waste my top-notch brain cells on simple problems like this? Make use of that dumb little brain of yours first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E008_1_1@Luluka is a genius fangirl! Coach can leave the mission of cheering everyone up to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E008_1_2@Nothing will go wrong~ Ehe☆
T_Dialog_Dialog_E008_1_3@Coach, do you know why one plus one equals two? Luluka still can't get it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E008_1_4@Ehe~ Hot buns are the best!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E008_1_5@It's one of the luckiest thing for Luluka to have the opportunity to cheer for Coach's team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E008_1_6@Coach, so you really don't need Luluka's help? You can ask for Luluka's favor anytime... Woah!!(falling down)
T_Dialog_Dialog_E009_1_1@Good day. How may I help you? Leave everything to me. I’ll make you satisfied, hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E009_1_2@My key to perfection? Just put your heart into everything~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E009_1_3@I’ve prepared everything flawlessly. Don’t worry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E009_1_4@(Whisper) I’m perfect... No worries...\nI’m perfect... I can only be perfect...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E009_1_5@(Whisper) Everything will be fine as long as everyone considers me perfect...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E009_1_6@Force myself more... until I reach my limit... Eh?! I, I didn’t say anything!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E010_1_1@Frozen water is the best for such a hot day.\nI've already prepared a bottle for Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E010_1_2@I love watching snow in winter. What's Coach's favorite season?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E010_1_3@I used to treat everyone coldly. Hard to imagine, isn't it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E010_1_4@To me... Coach is a trustworthy person. So... it's okay if you only touch me for once.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E010_1_5@I'm the eldest girl in our family, so I always have to take responsibilities for them. It's a little tough, but it indeed makes me a stronger person.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E010_1_6@Sometimes I still hope I can meet someone I can rely on, and maybe that person is... oh, nothing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E011_1_1@Wanna go on a date with me? How much are you gonna pay? Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E011_1_2@My salary today is not enough for a meal in a fancy restaurant at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E011_1_3@What is my pen for?\nTo record my expenses of course!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E011_1_4@I heard your team often go over budget. Do you need me for some financial management? Not for free of course.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E011_1_5@If the team wins because of my help, will I get a raise?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E011_1_6@Money is not everything, but no one can do without it. Do you agree with me, Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E012_1_1@It is more fun to play a game with more players after all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E012_1_2@It’s a bit of a waste for someone as strong as me to play support for you, but this is all for fame.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E012_1_3@That’s right, this is a special design. My in-game character wears this as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E012_1_4@If we’re talking PVP, I’m quite high up on the rankings!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E012_1_5@Besides in the water gun competition, you can catch me on a video game convention.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E012_1_6@Wanna add me as a friend in the game? \nFirst hone your skills to my level, and I’ll think about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E013_1_1@It will be prosperous today! There will be better luck in everything today~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E013_1_2@Oh? Moderate luck, that’s not bad, but beware of traffic problems~ \nYes, I’m talking about you! Don’t stare at your phone while you walk!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E013_1_3@A little luck. Just don’t be overly emotional, and everything should go well~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E013_1_4@Slight luck. You might run into some obstacles. If you are troubled, you can look for a few more trustworthy friends to discuss with, such as me~ Hehe!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E013_1_5@Bad luck... But don’t be nervous~ Just buy this talisman and you shall be fine... \nToo expensive? How can that be?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E013_1_6@The worst of luck?! I’m telling you, don’t go out the door today. Your luck will attract bloodshed!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E014_1_1@Can you prove you're different from those who only seek personal profit?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E014_1_2@What do you want from me? Plotting something bad again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E014_1_3@If you dare cross the line, I will make sure you suffer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E014_1_4@Hmph, don't think I trust you just because I'm talking to you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E014_1_5@I'm not done observing you yet. You better watch it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E014_1_6@Don't waste my time, I'm running late for Kagano and Scarlett's afternoon tea!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E015_1_1@D-Do you like this painting too? \nFreesia also likes it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E015_1_2@Yes, I always carry this harp on me... Is there is a song you would like hear?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E015_1_3@Freesia... Isn't good at talking to other people. \nSorry... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_E015_1_4@After this game... \nI want to go to the art museum...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E015_1_5@Whenever I look at works of art, it's as if I can feel the creator's vibrant soul... It's so beautiful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E015_1_6@I'm sorry... I was too caught up in performing... I didn't catch what you said... \nDid you need anything?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E016_1_1@Whaa... This again? How troublesome...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E016_1_2@No one can interrupt my sleep... except Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_E016_1_3@If only Coach only has eyes for me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E016_1_4@Do you like my outfit? Well... I'm wearing it just for you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E016_1_5@If I do this, Coach will be mine hehehe... Woah! Coach! Were you always here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E016_1_6@If Coach keeps touching me like this... I won't be able to hold it... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E017_1_1@Just by thinking about how exciting the competition can get, I can feel my blood boiling!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E017_1_2@I wish I can also join a water gun competition with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_E017_1_3@Coach, where do you think you're putting your hands?
T_Dialog_Dialog_E017_1_4@Coach, do you keep coming to talk to me because you're in love with me? Gosh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_E017_1_5@I'm fully ready! Coach, you only need to move forward with your genuine motivation!
T_Dialog_Dialog_E017_1_6@Did you feel that? I'm also delivering my energy warm as the sun to everyone today!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_1@Ah! Rina stole my pudding!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_10@But Rina is bullying me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_11@Ha ha ha ha…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_12@…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_13@You're not even listening to me...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_14@Rina, cut it out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_15@Damn... here she comes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_16@Yui, take your pudding. Rina, you can eat mine. There'd better not be any more pudding stealing from here on out, am I clear?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_17@Thank you, Sis Akane!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_18@Haha... Akane is acting like a kindergarten teacher.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_19@That's rich, coming from someone who's supposed to be in charge.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_2@It's just a pudding. Don't make a fuss.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_20@Excuse me? None of this would have been necessary if you hadn't stolen that pudding!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_21@Humph!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_22@Rina!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_23@OK! I get it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_24@Rina gave a look of boredom as she pranced off.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_25@Thank you for stopping that little scamp. You've been so much help lately.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_26@It's a pleasure to be of assistance, and I quite enjoy spending time with rest of the team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_27@Akane gave me a radiant smile—truly the exemplar of an ideal team member.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_28@You've always been a godsend. I had to rely on you a lot when I first joined the team, remember?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_29@Nah. I was just helping you learn the ropes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_3@In the lounge, Yui sniveled as she badgered Rina to return the stolen pudding to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_30@What led you to join the team, by the way?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_31@The foundation sponsoring the championship also runs my high school, so the first players were all scouted from among the graduates.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_32@Aha. So you are quite the veteran. I'd have to call you Big Sis Akane!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_33@Please... Don't.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_34@I'll continue to count on you, Big Sis Akane.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_35@Haha... I'm the one that counts on you, coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_4@As the coach, I'd been staying in the dormitory with my team, where such quibbles had become commonplace.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_5@(Right... As the coach, I need to show them who is in charge!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_6@You two! Quit it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_7@No. Gimme back!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_8@You can take this empty cup if you want.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_1_9@Hey—both of you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_1@I left the dormitory that night to meet with an old friend of mine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_10@You are such a baby. With that attitude, you'll never pick up a girl in the club.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_11@Don't be so harsh, man. Show me some fun!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_12@Hahaha! Alright then—strap in!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_13@As my friend and I entered the club, we were hit by the deafening bass beats blasting from inside, reverberating as if they were from a different dimension.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_14@The stage was quite a sight. Some people were making out, and a few girls were taking off their clothes and gyrating around the poles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_15@Oh my...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_16@I was making my way through the crowd when I spotted a girl in a hat standing under the emergency exit light. Her figure looked strangely familiar...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_17@Akane?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_18@How did she end up in a place like this? I'd better take a look. The girl spotted me and scurried off in a rush.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_19@Hey, wait!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_2@My friend had a reputation as a "party god" around the local nightclubs, and he'd agreed to take me on an "eye-opening" tour around Star City—a metropolis known for its vibrant nightlife scene.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_20@I caught up with her and grabbed her by the hand. She turned around, looking very anxious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_21@Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_22@How did you end up in here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_23@I was... curious...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_24@I see... and how has that worked out for you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_25@Akane blushed at my taunt. She was visibly embarrassed and hesitant, and didn't look at all like her usual, confident self.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_26@Well... It's quite a thrill...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_27@You know, if you are interested in this kind of scene, I can show you around.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_28@What? Well...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_29@Akane looked even more embarrassed, but showed no resistance to the idea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_3@I wonder what you have up your sleeve tonight, you old scamp.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_30@I smiled at Akane and whispered in her ear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_31@So we have a deal? Let's go back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_4@Haha. Up my sleeve? You're the one with an entire team of gorgeous women in your pocket!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_5@Those are only little girls. They fight over each other's pudding. But you know your way around mature women.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_6@You think? Don't you have that girl Akane on your team? She's really something, isn't she?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_7@How do you know her?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_8@She's quite the beauty. Any man would dream of having her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_2_9@Well... I think she's too perfect, and I feel a bit intimidated by her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_1@That day, everyone on the team was getting a routine medical checkup.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_10@I think so, too. But I like Sis Akane like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_11@Thank you, Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_12@And to show my gratitude... I'll give you a checkup, too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_13@Ahhh! Stop!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_14@Overhearing all the commotion and laughter the next room, I was quite amused.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_15@After a while, Akane knocked on my door to give me the report.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_16@She looked at me with rosy cheeks. She was breathing heavily, as if she had just finished a run. Someone's been having fun.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_17@Coach, today's medical checkup has been completed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_18@Akane tried to sound composed, as she didn't know I had overheard everything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_19@Thank you, Akane.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_2@Alright everyone, clothes off!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_20@You're welcome.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_21@I see everyone's noticed the change in your personality.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_22@Akane blushed nervously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_23@Uh... So you heard...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_24@Isn't it great? I appreciate the change in you as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_25@Really?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_26@This is how someone your age should behave. There's no need for pretense.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_27@... Okay.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_28@I used to act according to the book, like a good student... but now something is different.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_29@But it's thanks to you and everything you have taught me. I... I like the way I am now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_3@But... It's so embarrassing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_30@And that's great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_31@Yes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_4@Akane, what are you fussing about? Haven't we seen everything there is to see in the shower room?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_5@Sounds like someone has become a woman and doesn't want us to see. Hmm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_6@Ahhh! Stop touching me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_7@...Akane's more assertive now, isn't she?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_8@What? You think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_3_9@And also... more bubbly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_1@Coach, could you please sign on this document?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_10@It's nothing. I'll have to excuse myself, coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_11@Akane walked out of the room and heaved a sigh as she closed the door behind her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_12@What am I doing? I seem so foolish... This isn't like me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_13@She mumbled to herself as she pressed her forehead against the door, still clutching the gift box behind her back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_14@A few days later.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_15@I was still in a haze, handing off another paper I'd just signed to Akane.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_16@Akane, I'll leave that to you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_17@Sure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_18@As I turned around to go, Akane took a deep breath—as if having just made a big decision—and spoke to me in her usual voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_19@Excuse me, coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_2@As part of the formality, Akane had brought the paper to me personally.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_20@Hmm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_21@I've got something for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_22@Akane presented a delicately decorated gift box. I picked it up and opened it to find a wristband inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_23@You must spend a lot of time working at the computer, and may get a sore wrist from time to time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_24@I want you to have this as a thank you for everything you've been doing for the team. And please don't overwork yourself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_25@That's very sweet of you, Akane.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_26@I put on the wristband—it clasped perfectly around my wrist. It was quite comfy to wear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_27@It fits like a glove. Haha... I rarely get gifts from girls. I'm at a loss for words...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_28@As I scratched my head, Akane looked at me intensely for a moment and then muttered in a low voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_29@I... get lost for words, myself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_3@There you go... is this all right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_30@What?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_31@Akane stared at me with her rosy cheeks and her sparkling eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_32@But compared to procrastinating and worrying, it's such a relief to finally give this to you and get it off my chest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_33@This was rather important for me, so I didn't want to give up or change my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_34@And I have made up my mind!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_35@I was rather befuddled, as she rarely displayed such resolute spirit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_36@...I sound so crazy, don't I?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_37@No. I was just about to express my admiration... for your courage and honesty.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_38@A soft expression came to her face. I felt a gentle breeze sweeping over me, tugging at my heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_39@Akane tightened her fist in front of her bosom, as if holding something precious, and opened her mouth again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_4@Yes. Thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_40@Coach... I like you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_42@...?!?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_43@!!?!?!!?!?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_44@Uh... Haha... I've given you a heart attack.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_45@Akane giggled uncontrollably, like a child who'd just got away with a prank.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_46@Well you did... I mean...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_47@But I was serious. So serious, in fact, that it wouldn't be enough if you were to simply say "I like you, too".
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_48@But you don't have to say anything. I just wanted to tell you how I feel.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_49@Well, this... is a little awkward.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_5@……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_50@I mean, I'm the veteran player, so I'd better put my heart into everything I do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_51@Haha... I'll take that as a confession.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_52@Exactly. As someone who's been a part of the team for so long, I'd say I've earned the privilege to speak openly about how I feel.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_53@Akane broke out into a hearty laugh. Her laugh was indulgent, as if she'd just solved a hard riddle. It was a laugh I'd never forget.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_7@I mean... Akane, I've signed it now. Is there anything else?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_8@Uh... Well...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_4_9@Akane hesitated as if she was about to say something. Eventually, she brushed it off with a smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_1@In the silence of the night, I met with Akane  in her boudoir.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_10@Akane's face was flushed, but she could no longer prevent her pussy from being exposed to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_11@Lovely color. So lovely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_12@You compliment that...? It's so strange…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_13@Can I lick it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_14@It's too embarrassing…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_15@Then I'll fondle it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_16@I reached for the pink flower bud before Akane could refuse. She immediately trembled and groaned softly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_18@Are you feeling good?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_19@That…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_2@Akane  gingerly closed the door, for she was afraid to wake up the other sleeping girls in the dormitory  from our noises. She turned around and looked at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_20@Love juices are spilling out. You must be very excited, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_21@Do... not speak out... Ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_22@My finger tip gently twirled and caressed the soft, tender flower bud. Akane frowned and repeatedly trembled with my every touch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_23@Although she clamped her legs, her posture prevented her from shying away from my touch. Soon her pussy juices overflowed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_24@So sensitive... Ah! Do you usually touch it by yourself?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_25@Hmm... yes…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_26@Akane suppressed her gasp as she tried to answer me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_27@Where's that tight opening?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_28@Her groans, mixed with the dripping sound of her pussy, became louder and louder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_29@Oh, yeah... Only... with the fingers... Oh, no...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_3@In the dim light, shyness and uneasiness appeared on Akane's face, while her glistening eyes were full of anticipation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_30@Akane suddenly looked up as if she was coming, her body tightening.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_31@Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_32@I smeared the vaginal fluid on my hands across her legs, then pulled off her tights and panties from one of her thighs as she laid weak and limp.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_33@Show me your chest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_34@I reached out and undid one of the buttons on her blouse, immediately releasing her two round and respectable breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_35@She was blushing, panting, and her eyes were in a trance. Even she had no strength left to act coy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_36@I could now fondle her more conveniently. I grabbed her hands and folded them across her chest. Her soft breasts were warped erotically. I could clearly see her straightened, pink nipples.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_37@Let me give you something bigger than my fingers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_38@My penis, which had already been stiff for a long time, sprung forward and pressed against her pussy. It immediately felt well-lubricated from her moisture and heat, and her pussy opening seemed to contract with its craving for my shaft.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_39@Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh—It’s inside me... And it’s so hot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_4@I looked closely at her body in a leisurely manner. I couldn't help feeling excited thinking about how her exquisite figure, plump breasts and buttocks... all of her is going to belong to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_40@Hmm... It's so full inside... This is... a real penis…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_41@Wait a minute. I'll find the position where you feel most comfortable. Then I'll ram it hard so that you can't help carrying on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_42@As I was saying these dirty words, Akane did not shy away, but instead looked at me affectionately. Her eyes were pure and beautiful, but also showed a deep and lustful desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_43@Hmm... Come on, coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_44@I could feel the desire in her body and mind as her pussy constantly contracted to urge me on. I let my cock move in and out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_45@Well, uh... Ah... Your cock... Oh, yeah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_46@Akane, how do you feel... with my penis inside you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_47@Ah... The head of the shaft... rubs against my vaginal walls. It's so comfortable…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_48@Ah... My pussy walls feel as if they're opening for you. As your cock rubs back and forth... Ah, no...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_49@Mmm...! It's so hot... inside... Stir back and forth...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_5@Don't keep your eyes on me like that…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_50@As I intensified my movements, Akane's groans became a higher pitch. Our fluids mixed, and each insertion was accompanied by the sound of our sticky juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_51@Akane's breasts were extremely soft, and they shook up and down like marshmallows as her body shook with the movements of our intercourse.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_52@Uh, huh... Ah... Oh, yeah... It's so comfortable... Coach... It feels like its melting inside me…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_53@Akane, you don't have to endure... Just shout out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_54@Uh-huh! Ah, uh, uh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_55@Akane straightened up her waist. Even her toes curled as though she had already reached orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_56@Have you reached orgasm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_58@Don't apologize, but it's not over yet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_59@Oh, wait a minute. It's just... Ah...! Coach, um...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_6@Take it easy. Just leave it to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_60@Akane whined for mercy, but her pussy contracted violently. Her ecstasy was so intense that she could not bear any of it, so I was free to intensify my movements.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_61@Aaahhh... I'll teach you how much better it is to have multiple orgasms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_62@Uh, ah, ah—Mmm-hmm... Ah, ah... Oh, yeah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_63@Can't you hear me now? Akane, you're really enjoying this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_64@The intense, erotic pounding sounds paired with Akane's groans to fill the room. The gradual accumulation of pleasant sensations pushed us to orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_65@Oh, yeah... No... I'm coming again…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_66@Yes... I'm about to…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_67@Ejaculate... Coach ejaculate your sperm... into my uterus!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_68@Akane suddenly caught me by the waist with her legs. We clung to each other. My cock was so deep inside her pussy that it felt as if I was hitting the mouth of her uterus.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_69@Akane...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_7@I pushed Akane down on the bed, lifted her legs up directly, and pulled her tights down to her thighs without any trouble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_70@Uh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_71@I could not help but ejaculate in her depths. Stimulated by the hot sperm, Akane screamed as she reached climax with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_72@Haa... Haa.... Haa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_73@For a while, the only noise in the room was our desperate gasps.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_74@I pulled my half-hard cock out of Akane's pussy. The turbid, white fluid gurgled out of Akane's opening, and she reached down to touch some.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_75@The sperm is so hot... It's so nice…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_76@Akane looked at the milky, transparent mix of our liquids on her hand as if she was in a blissful trance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_77@She stretched her tongue out and gently licked some up. I could see the semen on the tip of her tongue, and she smiled mischievously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_78@Thank you, coach... I learned an important lesson tonight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h1_8@I pulled off Akane's panties easily, revealing her beautiful pink pussy between her plump buttocks... Her pussy looked virgin.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_1@It's already so late... Coach is going to worry about me again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_10@T-They looked so blissful... \nI wanted to see what it felt like too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_11@I can never forget my first time with Coach. I wonder when I can spend another wonderful night with him again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_12@So I beg you, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_13@I-I don't think I've ever done it outside before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_14@I'm unsure of what I should do, but I can't reject her after seeing Akane's begging eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_15@Fine, but can we first start from an alley somewhere close to the dormitory? \nNot a lot of people pass by, and the chances of being discovered is smaller.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_16@Really? Let's do that! Thank you, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_17@On the night that we agreed upon the sound of Akane panting can be heard in the dark alley. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_18@Hah... Mhmm... Nghh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_19@Akane allows my hands to wander all over her naked body, but seems to be holding back her voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_2@Hmm? Someone is in the park at this hour?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_20@You're the one that came up with this idea, and now you're scared of being seen?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_21@T-That's because this is my first time... I'm still nervous. Don't laugh at me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_22@Akane's flushed face as she tries to explain herself makes her seem even more delectable, and I pick up the speed of my cock thrusting into her pussy. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_23@Akane, turn around and stick up your ass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_24@Ok...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_25@Akane turns around hesitantly and does what I say. She still turns her head around to look at me and I can see the shyness in her eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_26@I grab her arms and slowly thrust my way inside of her. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_27@Aaaaahhhhhhhh... I love this...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_28@Akane raised her head. A tangled but ecstatic, lewd expression could be seen on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_29@I-I also want Coach to feel good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_3@Ahh... Coach, deeper... Deeper──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_30@Akane starts moving her hips on her own accord and our bodies make a wet lewd sound. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_31@Ah... Ah, ah... So good... Ah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_32@Akane's pussy contracts in excitement and the stimulation is too much for me as I spurt my cum deep inside of her. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_33@Ahh——That was faster than I expected...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_34@I'm happy, but please don't go soft on me too quickly Coach... While you're still inside of me, I also want to climax...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_35@Akane shook her waist recklessly. Her plump buttocks slapped against my legs, and my cock churned in the depths of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_36@Oh, yeah... Your cock ejaculated as it pounded into me... and stirred inside my depths... That's great... I'm coming…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_37@Akane, you're shouting so loud, someone must be coming by now…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_38@Aaahhh... Aaaahhh... I'm going to... Cock is so good... Aaahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_39@She doesn't seem to hear me at all... I swear, Akane has the voice of a porn star.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_4@Hehe, I guess it can't be helped~ I'm going to pick up the pace now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_40@Aaaaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_41@Akane convulses as she reaches climax and I can feel a warmth wash over my cock. The feeling is almost enough for me to cum once again. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_42@Ha, ah, ha, ah... Ha…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_43@Akane collapsed, her body seemingly paralyzed on top of me as she caught her breath... but I wasn't about to stop when I was in such high spirits.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_44@I held her buttocks, and my hard cock pressed against her opening, ready to insert again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_45@That's not enough.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_46@Wait a minute—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_47@Before Akane could stop me, I shoved my cock into the deepest part of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_48@Ah—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_49@Akane raised her neck and her body tensed up, but I kept thrusting into her relentlessly. Her body soon became weak and limp.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_5@Ahhh~~♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_50@Oh, yeah... Every time... This orgasm could throw me into a stupor... Oh, yeah... I’m, I’m...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_51@Go... Akane... I am about to cum!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_52@Come on... I want only player's sperm filling my womb... Come on...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_53@Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah—!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_54@Akane shook all over as she reached climax. Her contracting pussy also forced me to ejaculate.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_55@After our orgasm, Akane and I both collapsed, paralyzed in a euphoric trance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_56@Akane's breasts, thighs and buttocks were covered with my semen, and more was gurgling from the mouth of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_57@Oh, yeah... My first time, and it was so exciting... Will I get pregnant?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_6@(Wow, how bold. They're actually doing it outside?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_8@(I don't know why... but I'm kind of jealous of them.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h2_9@What? You also want to do it outside?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_001@I can vaguely recall that tumultuous night. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_002@I invited Akane, the manager of the team, for some "special training." \nShe considered my proposal and told me that we could have it in her room. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_003@At first I was actually nervous, but after seeing Akane's bashful expression I knew that I had nothing to worry about. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_004@Ahh, don't...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_005@Akane was pushed down on her bed with her clothes partially removed. \nWith just a few strokes of my fingers, Akane reaches her first climax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_006@For a girl with zero experience like her, Akane is really quite sensitive. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_007@Akane looks quite pitiful as she lies on her back helplessly. I take the chance to swiftly take off her clothes one by one. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_008@Her naked body is fully exposed in front of me for the first time. I feel all the blood rushing into my lower body and my cock swells in size.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_010@I impatiently press my cock against the entrance of Akane's trembling pussy and slowly push my way forward inch by inch. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_014@Akane's face is flushed red and her eyes gaze at me imploringly. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_016@Once I receive Akane's tacit agreement, I grab her legs and start thrusting in and out. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_022@Under my ferocious thrusting, the lewd sound of Akane's pussy fills the room. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_023@Her body sways with each impact of my hips and her full plump breasts also jiggle with each movement.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_025@Akane's virgin pussy engulfs my cock and it feels like I could melt from the heat. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_027@My cock speeds up as it churns inside of Akane's pussy. She moans in pleasure and looks even more slutty. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_028@I allow myself to sink into the pleasure and completely lose all sense of time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_032@Suddenly, Akane wraps her legs around my waist. My cock hits her womb as she pulls me closer. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_034@This sudden attack pushes me over the edge and I can't hold back my lust any longer. I spew my hot white cum deep within Akane. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_036@After our climax, only the sound of panting can be heard in the room. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_037@Hah... Hah... Your cum is so hot... It feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_038@The first taste of the forbidden fruit is always the most special and memorable for a girl. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_039@Coach... Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_040@Do you want to go another round? I can keep going...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_041@Want what~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_042@Woah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_043@Akane's slightly raised voice pulls me back to reality. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_044@Coach, are you thinking dirty thoughts again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_045@N-No. What makes you say that? Anyways, what brings you here, Akane?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_046@I just wanted to remind Coach that it's about time. Everyone is waiting for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_047@Ahh... OK, I'll be right there!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_048@W.A.T.E.R. ── is a recent global competition that has been gaining traction. It has led to the girls water gun competition coming into the global spotlight. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_049@This is where it all starts, Star City. \nI will be leading my water gun team to particiapte in their first competition. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_050@I have always aspired to stike it big one day in this sport and become a W.A.T.E.R. champion!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_h4_1_051@My team may have been freshly formed, \nbut with the trustworthy Akane at my side, I'm sure everything will be alright. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_1@As we head back home, Akana hangs her head all along the way.\nSeeing how we still have a way to go, I try to break the ice. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_10@(Is this... a confession?! No way... Akane likes me...?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_11@I should put it this way. I want to know what Coach and others like.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_12@I... want to be closer to you guys.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_13@... So this is how it is?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_14@Now that I think about it, Akane is mature and dependable. But her perfection makes her seem a little unapproachable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_15@You must think I'm too intrusive to find other people's hobbies by investigating their private lives...\nI'm sorry... if you're bothered by this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_16@You don't have to apologize.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_17@Eh? But──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_18@Isn't this how Akane has always approached learning? You look up information and absorb the knowledge...\nThat's what makes you a straight-A student.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_19@However, if it's about making friends, Akane only has to be yourself and just open your heart to other people. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_2@I didn't expect Akane to be interested in going to nightclubs. That kind of place is quite different from your image. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_20@Open my heart...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_21@Yes. You might be even more popular if you show the "Akane" that is not the usual "reliable senpai" to others.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_23@I got it. Thank you, Coach. I really made a wonderful decision to investigate you today. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_25@Haha... We're here at the dorm. You go in first. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_26@Alright. Good night, Coach. Please don't stay up too late. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_27@After seeing Akane off, I sigh while unconsciously stretching my wrists. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_28@Ah~ I thought that I could finally relax today.\nMaybe I spent too much time dealing with the team's affairs. My wrists are really sore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_29@... Anyways. It's my fault for being such a good coach \nwho prioritizes the feelings of my team members over my own enjoyment. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_3@Well... That's because...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_30@After stretching, I pull open the gate to the dorm and walk towards my room. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_31@In the darkness of the night, I didn't notice that Akane was standing in the hallway and witnessed everything just then. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_4@Akane looks pretty shy with her rosy cheeks beneath the moonlight.\nI just can't resist playing jokes on her after seeing her like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_5@So, which part of the night club are you most interested in? Don't tell me it's the pole dancing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_6@Uh, actually...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_7@Akane takes a deep breath as if she's about to make an important decision.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_8@I-I'm interested in... Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_1_9@What?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_1@I thought Akane's confession would give me butterflies in my stomach, but I was as busy as a bee due to my huge workload and the thought was competely pushed to the back of my head. A week swiftly passed in the blink of an eye. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_10@Rina frowns out of dissatisfaction. But soon, a naughty smile blooms on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_11@Practicing is just too boring. Now that player is here, we should do some challenges.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_12@... I have a bad feeling...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_13@Combine what I've taught you just now to perform a pole dance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_14@What?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_15@P-pole...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_16@That's right! But we need to find a pole here, so...\nplayer! I choose you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_17@I thought I was a human being?! Also, don't say stuff that might get us copy striked!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_18@Hehehe~ Could it be that... you're afraid?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_2@I've finally sent out the last file... Now I can finally relax for a little bit. I guess the members are also relaxing as there is no training today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_20@Akane's face turns as red as a tomato.\nIt's hard to express what I feel when I see her being so shy and nervous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_21@Well... Rina, you should be the one to be afraid.\nYou still owe me one set of core muscle training from last week.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_22@Ugh. That's──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_23@As I said──If you don't finish it, you'll be left on the bench in the next match.\nDo you really want to give up the chance to show yourself?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_24@... I'll go finish it now. You sly thing! Don't you ever put me on the bench!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_25@After Rina stalks out of the room angrily, I turn to Akane.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_26@Rina is just joking. Don't mind her... I won't force you to do anything you hate.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_27@Akane nods, but then shakes her head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_28@I don't hate it. If player wants, I can dance for you.\nHowever, I hope it's after I get more skillful... since I don't want to embarrass myself in front of you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_29@(Has my hobby been misunderstood as watching pole dances...? But still, I'm flattered to hear that.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_3@Hm? Not too shabby.\nThere! Lift your butt higher!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_30@Well, Akana can just focus on doing what you like.\nI like to see the real you... and I think other people are thinking the same way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_31@After hearing what I said, Akane lifts her head.\nI can see myself reflected in her eyes that are moist after exercising.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_32@──she suddenly gets close to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_34@And then she goes away.\nCompletely stupefied, I raise my hand to touch my cheek that is still warm and wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_35@What... just... happened...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_36@Did Akane... just kiss me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_4@Yes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_5@This sounds like... Rina and Akane?\nWhat brings these two girls together?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_6@I walk towards the living room out of curiosity. There, the table and the sofa are moved aside and the two girls are dancing in the cleared out space.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_7@Maybe they have been practicing for a while, seeing how Akane's wet top shows her sweaty but delicate shape\nand how her breasts heave up and down in her shirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_8@You guys are... practicing dancing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_2_9@Isn't it obvious? I thought Akane wasn't interested in dancing, but she can actually keep up with me, though her moves aren't perfect yet. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_1@After that, Akane still helps me manage the team as usual.\nBut I'll always think of that afternoon when I was kissed by Akane whenever I see her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_10@Well... Actually...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_12@One, one-day boyfriend?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_13@Sorry. I know how difficult it would be for Coach.\nBut my friends keep trying to introduce guys to me. I was really nervous, so I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_14@So you accidentally said "I already have a boyfriend" when you wanted to say "I already have someone in my mind"... That doesn't sound like a mistake the careful Akane would make.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_15@Yes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_16@So, now they're asking you to bring your boyfriend to hang out with them. And you want me to play the role?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_17@If it's not convenient for Coach, I can totally understand and I'll figure some way else.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_18@(Aren't you being so afraid of being rejected by me? Just see how your lips are trembling...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_19@I'll go. We'll meet in front of the dorm gate at noon tomorrow, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_2@Crap. I can't look at Akane at all, for my heart always skips a beat when I do so...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_20@...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_21@Y-yes! Then I'll count on you, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_22@The next day, I come to an izakaya with Akane.\nAnd as expected, there are endless waves of questions from her friends.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_23@How long have you been together? How did you two meet each other? Why hasn't Akane mentioned you any single time?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_24@Akane looks at me with a difficult smile, and I give her a "Don't worry" eye in return.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_25@We've been together for a while. I'm the Coach of her team. I guess Akane chose to keep our relationship lowkey in fear of influencing my job. Sometimes I feel pretty worried about Akane for she is just too considerate.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_26@Woah──You two make me so jealous! As punishment, Akane, you should take a shot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_27@Ahaha, is it okay for me to take it instead?\nAfter hearing how great the sake here is, I've always wanted to try some.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_28@You're taking the punishment for her? Akane, your boyfriend is really nice to you──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_29@With my help, Akane's friends finally stop their suspicion about our relationship. The delightful atmosphere around the table continues until the gathering ends. After parting with Akane's friends, she and I walk back to the dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_3@Hm? Who's that over there?... Akane?\nI should just avoid her then...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_30@Coach, thank you so much for today...\nand sorry for troubling you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_31@It's no trouble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_32@... I should say... I hope you can bother me more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_33@Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_34@I take a deep breath.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_35@Why not remove the "one-day" from your request? I... I want to be Akane's boyfriend.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_36@... Is this... your answer?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_37@Yes. There's no reason for me not to respond to Akane's confession.\nPlease be by my side as my girlfriend.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_38@Akane doesn't say a word but softly nods. With the light of the sunset sprinkled on Akane, the smile on her delicate face framed by her hair pulls on my heartstrings.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_4@...Why... why does she keep walking towards me?\nNo. I'm not mentally prepared yet──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_5@Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_6@Ah, yes, sir!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_7@I stand straight up with feet together and give Akane a military salute.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_8@Pfft. Coach, what are you doing?\nYou don't have to be so formal with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P001_N_3_9@Ah, uh, well... Haha.\nHmm, Akane, what brings you here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_1@A gentle breeze under the rainbow... fondly caressing her cheeks.♪
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_10@Yui started another song on her pretend stage. Sometimes her exuberance was taxing to behold.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_11@I walked quietly to the serving counter at the far end of the room. I asked Akane for a coffee and then watched the performance from a distance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_12@That girl is always radiating with energy. I truly admire her for that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_13@Yui was an idol singer by profession. Her agency sent her to join our team in order to increase her public presence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_14@Haha... I'm also impressed with her sincerity and vigor!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_15@But it must be a challenge for her to fill the role of both singer and athlete.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_16@Yui has been working very hard. She's such a sweet girl. Even with all those things on her plate, she still greets everyone with her signature smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_17@Oh, so that’s the case...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_19@That night, on the training ground...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_2@Yui is stealing the show!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_20@Oh no... I forgot to lock the doors... It's so chilly at night...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_21@Ho!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_22@Someone's inside?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_23@I walked to the doors and peeked inside. Yui was alone on the training ground, repeating the same moves over and over—turning around, rolling over, shifting to the side...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_24@...Yui?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_25@She looked at me for several seconds before finally registering my presence, then stopped her training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_27@She was soaked in sweat. From her rosy cheeks and heaving chest, I could tell her training must have been quite intense.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_28@I forgot to lock the doors today. Is that how you got in here to do these drills?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_29@Haha... Actually, I've been doing this every so often for a while now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_3@As I walked into the lounge, I saw Yui singing and hopping up onto the table while Rina clapped along off to the side. It took me a moment to take in what I saw.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_30@With a wry smile, Yui bounced up as gracefully as a ballet dancer, then turned around to give me the V sign.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_31@Ta-da! Fight and Victory!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_32@Is there a connection between the two?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_33@I broke out into a giggle. But I wouldn't let this little imp change the subject.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_34@Have you been coming here every day?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_35@Well, being an idol and playing for the team are both very important to me, so I have to practice hard!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_36@...And when do you get any sleep?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_37@I heaved a sigh. Now I could see the signs of fatigue on her face. She had some work with her agency earlier in the afternoon, so she must have come here in the evening.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_38@She never seemed to fall behind on the team, and I had always thought her agility was the result of training she'd received as a dancer... I guess I was wrong.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_39@Neither being an idol nor playing for the team is a breeze, and Yui had to work twice as hard to make it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_4@...What is this? Rina, you must be as drunk as an old geezer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_40@But she never complains. She works hard all by herself and spreads joy to everyone around her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_41@...Don't you feel burned out sometimes?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_42@Not really. I enjoy making those around me happy, and that's always worth it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_43@Yui beamed at me without a single trace of regret on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_44@...I may have underestimated you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_45@Huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_46@Nothing. But over-training is counterproductive. Let's call it a day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_47@I patted her on the head. She blinked at me and broke into a big, radiant smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_48@Great!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_49@Under the starlit sky, we walked back to the dormitory together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_5@I've got a TV concert in two days and I need to practice!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_50@Yui was an emerging idol, but also a dedicated and diligent member of our team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_6@And they will let you sing that in a TV concert?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_7@Huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_8@Nothing. Never mind... Go for it, Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_1_9@Alright. Let's move on to the next tune! Oh would you please tell me... where am I in your heart? ♪
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_1@One day, I went to see the filming of a show where Yui was to make an appearance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_10@And from the blue team, "The Chieftain"—Dumbbell!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_11@A burly man with the look of a wrestler emerged from the other team. The crowd went silent for a moment, enthralled by his intimidating presence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_12@(...How can they let Yui face such an opponent? What is the production team thinking?!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_13@And it starts... now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_14@The two of them promptly turned around and dashed towards the table at almost equal speeds. But the wrestler got his weapon first, and he turned around to launch his attack.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_15@Ah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_16@Yui was shot in the leg. As she tried to dodge, she slipped on a patch of bubbles on the ground and fell down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_17@Yui!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_18@I couldn't help shouting, and the crowd also let out a cry. Dumbbell immediately took advantage of Yui's fall and hit all her remaining balloons.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_19@But even after Yui's balloons were popped, he relentlessly discharged his cartridge all over her face, chest and thighs. Yui was soon soaked in bubbles, looking like a poor, drenched puppy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_2@In fact, I was no more than a spectator among the gathering crowd.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_20@...That's just mean!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_21@I frowned as I looked on. Do they really have to do that, even if it's for the sake of the show?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_23@I thought Yui would be absolutely crushed by her defeat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_24@But she didn't cry, nor was she angry. She silently wiped the bubbles off her face and pouted her lips mischievously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_25@Damn. I won't give up just like that! Now it's my turn!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_26@Yui! Teach that bastard a lesson!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_27@I said this in a low voice, but Yui seemed to notice and turned towards me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_28@Our eyes met briefly before she looked up and treated the crowd with her signature, gleaming smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_29@The match begins now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_3@Hello, I am Yui!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_31@This time, Yui rolled and tumbled swiftly toward the bubble guns.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_32@That's it! Keep your body low. Steady now, aim—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_33@—and fire!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_34@As the wrestler turned around, he was fed three perfect shots from Yui and was instantly defeated.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_35@Bravo!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_36@I shouted while shaking my fist in the air, startling a few spectators around me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_37@Yui's eventually won the game, and the show was a success.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_38@Once the show ended, Yui ran to me in gleeful spirits.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_4@(Wow. She looks like a different person.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_40@Yui, you did an amazing job!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_41@Before Yui could say anything back, she was surrounded by fans gathering around her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_42@Are you Yui? Your performance was absolutely amazing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_43@May I have your autograph?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_44@Big sis, you rock!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_45@Uh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_46@Yui was taken back by the enthusiasm of her fans, and looked at me helplessly. I signaled her to give them a proper thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_47@Thank you! Thank you, everyone!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_48@Yui thanked her fans wholeheartedly, posing for photos and giving autographs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_49@She faced me again and gave me a look of triumph. I waved at her and turned to leave.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_5@Today we will be hosting a contest between two teams: red and blue. In the first round, each team sends out a member. That player will be asked to turn around 30 times before running to the table and picking up the bubble gun to fight their opponent.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_50@Never giving up the smile on her face, even when faced with difficulties—Yui's personality motivated everyone around her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_51@(I'd better get Yui's latest album on my way home... I think I may have just become a fan.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_6@The first player to hit the balloons on their opponent's arms, back, and legs wins. The winning team will be chosen from best-out-of-three.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_7@Let's kick-start the first round! From the red team, the up-and-coming idol—Yui!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_8@Leave it to me, guys!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_2_9@(Wow... She's the first one to go...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_1@*Yaaaawwwnn...*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_10@I noticed that the booklets we were picking up had her photos printed on them, along with lyrics from her albums.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_11@And these are?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_12@Yui's eyes sparkled at my question. She grabbed one of the booklets and held it in right front of my face, like a little girl showing off her toys.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_13@Ta-da! These are gifts I have to give away at the signing event.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_14@Wow! You are going to have a signing event for your fans?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_15@Exactly, for the release of my new EP!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_16@Congratulations. I'll be your fan, as well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_17@Wow, my coach is my newest fan? I'm so flattered!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_18@Yui picked up a brand new booklet and handed it to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_19@In that case, you'd better take this, coach! You are the first person to get one, you know!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_2@That morning, I yawned profusely in my drowsiness as I walked out of the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_20@Thank you. I'll be at the signing event, too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_21@Great! It's a deal!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_22@Sure. Keep it up, Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_23@On the day of the signing event...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_24@That day, I went to Yui's signing event as agreed. The venue was pretty small, and less than half of the seats were taken. It was quite a sorry sight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_25@(It turned out there was a huge difference in popularity between super stars and idols like Yui. I hope she won't be too disappointed...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_26@When I came back from my thoughts, the event had already started. Yui appeared on the stage and greeted her fans with her signature, radiant smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_27@Hello, everyone! Welcome to my signing event!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_28@The dull atmosphere in the room seemed to have been penetrated by a ray of sunshine. The fans were excited by her radiant presence!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_29@(Yui is owning her fans...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_3@Ah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_30@I stopped worrying about Yui and had just had a great time along with the other fans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_32@After the event, I went backstage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_33@Yui, you did so great!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_34@Coach! Thank you for coming. How did you like today's event?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_35@I had a great time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_36@Excellent!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_37@But Yui, are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_38@Huh? What?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_39@I mean... Not that many fans showed up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_4@Then I walked right into Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_40@Well... I do feel a bit down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_41@Yui's smile wavered, but she recovered it before I could offer any words of consolation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_42@But it's okay. My fans were here, and I'm happy that you came, too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_43@My mission is to bring others happiness, and I must try my best regardless of how many people show up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_44@I see.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_45@I have to say, I'm impressed with your determination.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_46@Thank you, coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_48@Yui smiled softly. It wasn't her usual, idol-like smile, but it was more telling of how she really felt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_49@This is the first time I've confided in another person this way. Thank you for hearing me out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_5@There was a flutter as the things she was holding scattered across the floor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_50@Hm... But I haven't done anything. You cheered up all on your own, didn't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_51@But that was thanks to you, coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_52@Yui giggled and then turned to collect her booklets bashfully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_53@That's it, then! I have to run to the next show. See you later tonight!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_54@Keep up the good work!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_55@Yui stopped running and paused in the doorway. She turned around to give me a broad, triumphant smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_56@Yes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_6@Ah... Sorry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_7@I immediately bent down to pick up the things for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_8@That's alright! Good morning, coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_3_9@Still wearing that smile, Yui crouched down to collect her things with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_1@Yui had something big coming up, and she'd been bustling all over the place as of late.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_10@Haha... I can see you are pretty excited about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_11@It's only thanks to the support of my fans that I now get to perform at such a great venue, so I'd better not let everyone down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_12@But... What is that thing you are working on?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_13@Ah! Well-spotted!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_14@Yui raised the object in her hands. It looked like a small placard with the word "happiness" written on it, sporting some small decorative details.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_15@This is the present I'm going to give away to my fans!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_16@Everyone will get one?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_17@Exactly!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_18@But how long will it take to make them all...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_19@That's not a problem. I have enough time to prepare!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_2@As it turned out, it would soon be the first anniversary of her debut as an idol.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_20@But don't you have tons of these to do? May I help you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_21@Huh? But these are gifts from me to the fans. I'm supposed to do it myself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_22@Hm... How about we divide the tasks? I'll cut the paper and you can write the messages, okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_23@Okay!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_24@Yui's spirits were lifted. She quickly prepared a space for me at her desk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_25@Bright lights twinkled like little stars. The venue was packed with throngs of fans chanting the name of their beloved star...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_26@I was backstage, watching Yui performing on stage from the screen. Come to think of it, Yui attracted little attention when she issued her first EP, but she never gave up, and finally earned herself stardom.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_27@Yui has been working so hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_28@Seeing a close-up of her on the screen, I felt truly happy for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_3@Yui, are you okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_30@Coach! I've done it! I've really done it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_31@After the concert, Yui couldn't hold back her excitement as she hopped around me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_32@You pulled off a brilliant show!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_33@Yeah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_34@And the fans were ecstatic when those gifts were handed out. And did you see who's trending now on social media?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_35@Really? That's amazing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_36@Right, coach! You deserve a present, too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_37@You don't mean one of those cards, do you? I've seen enough of those... Have mercy on me this time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_38@Not that! It's something custom-made for you! ...Ta-da!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_39@Yui produced a small sachet from her handbag and presented it ceremoniously in front of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_4@I came to Yui's room and saw she was busy working on something at her desk. She was quite surprised to see me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_40@It was a hand-made cologne sachet in bright red and blue colors, with a water-gun motif awkwardly embroidered on it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_41@I was deeply moved as I thought of all the extra time Yui had spent to make this, but I also felt sorry for her at the same time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_42@...How long did it take you to make this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_43@Never mind that! You have been so supportive and helpful to me along the way, so you deserve the most special gift!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_44@Yui said this with a twinkle in her eye. Her look was full of sincerity and innocence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_45@She took the carefully hand-knitted sachet and gently handed it over to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_46@As I took the sachet from Yui, I grabbed her hands and held her in my arms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_47@Thank you, Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_48@Yui blinked in surprise. She tried to step away at first, but my warm embrace finally persuaded her to stay and nestle in my arms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_49@She'd been working hard to become a true star and to bring joy to her fans. She never gave up, despite all the hardships along the way. Now she knew...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_50@Yui gently closed her eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_51@Everything was worth it for the sake of this moment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_6@Do you need any help? I've noticed that long face has been haunting you for some time now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_7@Thank you for asking, coach... Well, I guess it's been rather hectic for me, what with my preparation for the anniversary.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_8@So will you be performing a live concert?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_4_9@Exactly! And we will do it at SUPER☆LIVE, a dedicated concert hall! They've got all the cool, latest equipment, along with a huge stage!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_1@What should I do? It's my first live TV show. I'm so nervous…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_10@Then I'll tell you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_12@I saw Yui on the stage. She was a little reserved, and she seemed too scared to move.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_13@Hello, everyone... I'm Yui...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_14@(So naive.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_15@I stealthily pressed the remote control button in my hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_16@Aahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_17@Yui trembled all over. Her exclamation was clearly heard through her microphone. All she could do was try to suppress the vibration in her pussy and act foolishly in front of the camera lens.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_18@Ah, ah... I almost fell down... So humiliating... Hmph—I'm going to do well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_19@With the music, Yui started to dance. She danced carefully step by step.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_2@Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_20@A adult toy was sitting suspended inside her pussy. As long as she didn't move too violently, the toy would stay tight in her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_21@(Uh... Uh... It's numb... I feel so hot...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_22@After practicing thousands of times, Yui was able to perform her dance like a reflex. But the thrill from the adult toy took up everything in her brain.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_23@(Next move, let's see... Eeek...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_24@Yui tried to keep smiling. She could see all the grins and expectant eyes of her fans in the audience.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_25@They did not know that along with her singing and dancing on the stage, she was also making another bold, more private performance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_26@(Ah, ah... Doing this on stage...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_27@Shame and pleasure blended. Yui was unconsciously immersed in her mix of emotions.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_28@I looked at Yui's face, releaved. Even though the sexual regulation was working, it wasn't much fun.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_29@*Click.* I stepped up the remote control.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_30@Yui shivered unnaturally on stage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_31@(No, no, no... If it's any stronger...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_32@A relieving, pleasant sensation surged up. Yui could not help tightening her whole body. She knew that her pussy was becoming more sensitive. If it went on like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_33@She felt her pussy juices building up, and some of her fluid started running down the inside of her thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_34@(Please, please, please, don't be noticable...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_35@Against all reason, Yui could clearly feel more vaginal fluid dripping from her pussy before she could do anything about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_36@(Maybe I'm a crazy kinky girl... Maybe not...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_37@Yui was in a trance as the pleasure from the toy continued to increase.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_38@(Ah, ah... The last move...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_39@Yui got ready to do the splits for her final dance position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_4@Yui, are you feeling nervous?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_40@(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh—)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_41@The adult toy held tight inside Yui's pussy. She was smiling, and her mind had gone blank.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_42@Thanks, thanks... Everybody…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_43@Yui couldn't remember how she ended up backstage. Wasn't she just... on stage?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_44@She didn't know when the adult toy had stopped vibrating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_45@(Why... why did you stop it?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_46@Yui, you performed very well. Now here's a reward for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_47@*Click, click!* I turned the toy up to its maximum setting all at once.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_48@Yiahhhhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_49@Yui unreservedly shrieked this time, reaching a sudden and intense climax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_5@A little bit…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_50@She convulsed, unable to recover from her orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_51@Ahhh... Aaahhhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_52@After a while, a pool of fluid flowed out of Yui's pussy, wetting her delicate dancing outfit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_53@Yui, it was a perfect performance. Congratulations.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_6@I know a bit of magic that can make you focused.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_7@Really?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_8@But that is the kind of magic that only adults can use. I don't know whether you can handle it, Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h1_9@I can! I'm an adult now! I'll try anything to help me perform well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_1@Backstage, Yui was waiting for the special meet-and-greet. She was a little nervous, and her face was like stone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_10@Thank you for your support... Ah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_11@My hand gently touched Yui's buttocks and wantonly kneaded her soft, tender ass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_12@Yui could not respond or dodge, but only endure and smile toward the fans in front of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_13@I'm... I'm okay. Thank you for your support~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_14@(Stop it...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_15@Yui quietly wriggled her buttocks, wanting to escape—but I had other plans. She felt me slip her panties off from under her skirt, and my strong hand cupped her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_16@(Wah...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_17@She endured my touch, keeping her body stiff. She fought to resist the pleasure, but her sensitive body was powerless to the sexual stimulation. Vaginal fluid flowed from her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_18@(No, no... Fingers... It's so good...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_19@Her pussy tightly wrapped around my fingers, and erotic pounding sounds could be heard by the fans in front of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_2@Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_20@But since Yui adapted to the situation well, I didn't have to worry about anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_21@I pulled down her skirt and inserted my hard cock straight into her wet, hot, tight pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_22@(Ah—Come in...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_23@Yui suddenly lost her mind and even forgot the fans in front of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_24@Ah! I'm sorry, I'm losing my mind. I have been a bit tired lately... Hmm... It's nothing. Just... *Cough*... Thank you for your concern.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_25@The loud, erotic pounding sounds followed a rhythm, back and forth, in and out, all in front of the fans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_26@(Ah... You are pounding... I can't believe I'm doing this in front of my fans...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_27@Yui held a smiling face, trying to seem normal, but my gradually accelerated and aggravated rhythm made her have to use all her strength just to suppress groans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_28@(If you do me like this... I can't focus on anything else... But I am doing this meet-and-greet...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_29@Her pussy seemed to become one with my cock as the erotic pounding sounds continued. Her pussy juices kept flowing, and everyone could hear the sound of my thrusts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_30@(The fans at the back look weirded out. Can they see anything from that angle...?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_31@(I want to get it over with as soon as possible... Then I don't have to cover up. I want to really do your cock...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_32@With the erotic pounding sounds, Yui's pleasure kept increasing. Every insertion made her pussy feel limp and numb, and she couldn't keep from groaning. Her smile seemed to be a little stiff…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_33@(It's all right... Ah, ah, ah... Cock, cock, cock, cock...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_34@(It's time to go... I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go... finish the meet-and-greet...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_35@(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah—)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_37@While she was counting the people in the crowd, her agent came over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_38@Yui, this is going to be the last one... Yui?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_39@Yui was paralyzed in her current position. Her mind was blank, and her cheeks were blushing bright red. Hearing the agent's call, she smiled weakly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_4@I'll cheer you up. Don't worry. I'll be with you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_40@Ah... Yes... It's been a long day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_5@Yui understood my words. Her eyes twinkled with anticipation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_6@Mm-hmm... Thank you, coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_8@Sitting behind a long table, Yui smiled and shook hands with her fans. I stood behind her, separated only by a curtain.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_h2_9@This is really a very convenient position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_1@Ugh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_10@Much better. Kagano is such a kind girl who warms both my stomach and heart~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_11@Stop being s-stupid! That's only because you are an important property to our team... Yes! That's the reason!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_12@Having such a terrible situation just because of your first live is a sign of immaturity. You still need to train yourself more!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_13@That's right! I need to work harder to stop getting nervous because I'm overcaring about something!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_14@As someone who always looks confident, can Kagano teach me how to stop being nervous?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_15@Wha-what?! I never feel nervous, so I guess you're asking the wrong person!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_16@Ah, I guess so.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_17@I just asked without considering. I'm sorry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_18@... Don't just apologize so quick. I... actually...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_19@Hm? Kagano? What was that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_2@Hmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_20@... I said Itsuki. How about asking her?\nEven though I don't know much about ninja, I guess they are usually under high pressure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_21@That makes sense! Okay, then I'll talk to Itsuki!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_23@Nervous... I'm so sorry. I've never felt like that while executing my missions.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_24@So that's how it is... That's right. Itsuki is a tough girl as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_25@It's not about being tough or not. I'm just focusing on the "correct direction."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_26@The correct direction?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_27@My missions are usually matters of life and death.\nIf I keep thinking about "once I fail, I'll die," then I'll be placing my energy in the wrong direction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_28@Worries are meaningless. Therefore, there's only a correct direction to survive. That is, put all your focus on the target.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_29@...! That's right! I'll just focus on my performance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_3@What are you doing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_30@Okay, I'll try it now... Hmmmm──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_31@Waaahh~ I still can't help getting nervous when I think about the audience down the stage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_32@Close your eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_33@Eh? Okay!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_34@Inhale, and feel how your blood flows in your body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_35@... Thump, thump...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_36@(It's my heartbeat... It sounds so stable...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_37@I'm really feeling relaxed! Itsuki is amazing! Is this ninja's magic?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_38@Uh, no, or I should call it ninjutsu?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_39@No. That's not ninjutsu──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_4@Woah! Kagano?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_40@Haha! But I'm feeling energetic again. Thank you, Itsuki! I believe everything will go well tomorrow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_41@... Okay. Good luck.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_5@Why are you pressing your stomach while walking around with such a pale face?... Did you eat something bad?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_6@No, no. I'm alright──Uggh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_7@Hey! Wha-what's wrong?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_1_9@Being too nervous to eat anything... I can't believe it. Have you gotten better after drinking the milk?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_1@Clank!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_10@Your songs were such a huge support to me when I was down. Thank you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_11@Thank you for saying that! I'll keep on the hard work!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_12@(Well... It's so hard to keep my balance in this pair of shoes too big for me. My feet hurt a little...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_13@(But it's almost over. Yui, you can do it!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_14@The next──What? Coach and Nadeshiko sis? Why is everyone here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_15@There's no training today, so we're here to support our cutest idol.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_16@I saw you going out in new heels today, but I've heard that the quality of that shoe brand is not so stable. So I brought you another pair just in case.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_17@Nadeshiko sis... You're an angel...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_18@I'm glad I can help. Here, put them on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_19@And here, take it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_2@Ah… !
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_20@My bottle? Ah, isn't this the throat tea I always drink?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_21@Kagano is so worried about Yui. I saw her kept walking around before we came out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_22@Stupid Tomoka! Stop talking nonsense!\nI just, just can't believe how would somebody hold a handshake event without drinking anything!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_23@I guess her manager will prepare it for her... Zzzzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_24@Tomoka? No way! You're sleeping while standing?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_25@Hehe~ I feel so relaxed with Tomoka. Let's get some rest together after this handshake event!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_26@Good... Bed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_27@Hey! Don't fall asleep here! You're embarrassing our team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_28@Hahaha! They look so happy together!\nI've heard that Yui joined a water gun team, but I didn't expect the members to get along so well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_29@Yes! The team, and you fans who have been supporting my performance...\nI can keep on working all because of you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_3@Yui! Are you okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_30@Please keep on supporting me afterwards!~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_4@It's just the heel broke accidentally. I'm alright.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_5@How could it happen now that the handshake event is about to start...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_6@I just saw a pair of shoes in the green room. Let's ask if we can borrow it for a while.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_7@But it may not be your size...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_2_8@It's okay. It won't be too long. So many fans are here. I cannot just make them wait out there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_1@After the handshake event, Yui's fans start to grow an interest in the water gun competition.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_10@Yui, who always appears energetic, is now lowering her head, peeking at me through her bang.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_11@I'm afraid that my reaction might be unnatural without someone actually interacting with me behind the camera. But I don't really have time to train my acting skill right now, so I want to find someone I'm more familiar with...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_12@So that's how it is. It's not like I can't do this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_13@Then I'll count on Coach! I'll tell my manager right away!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_14@She looks so excited... I guess things should be alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_15@The next day, I come to the amusement park with Yui. The stream starts right after some brief instructions from the staff.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_16@Let's go buy some drink there! How about black tea?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_17@Yui look at me, who is standing behind the camera. I nod to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_18@You like my choice? Awesome!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_19@A smile brighter than the sun blooms on Yui's face. I can't help flip a little bit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_2@Maybe this is what's called a "win-win situation." Not only the supporters of the team are increasing, but the number of Yui's fans is also skyrocketing. She is so popular now that she even...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_20@(Yui is really... adorable. Her fan must be happy.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_21@Then, I follow the camera team and Yui all over the amusement park.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_22@Riding on the merry-go-round, driving in bumper cars, and sharing a drink together... We have so much fun that the sun soon sets on the west before we know. Meanwhile, the stream is coming to an end as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_23@I really had so much fun with you today. Thank you so much for coming with me. Where should we go next time?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_24@The cameraman presses the stop button, and the stream ends with Yui's sweet smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_25@Okay. That's all for today. Thank you all so much for the work.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_26@Thank you guys~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_27@Yui looks especially happy today. Could it be because...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_28@The cameraman peeks at me and walks away in laughter, leaving Yui and I standing there awkwardly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_29@Well... Now that everyone's leaving, should we go back, too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_3@You even won the election of "the idol I want to date the most"... How impressing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_30@Coach, are you in a hurry?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_31@I'm not. What's the mat... Ferris wheel?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_32@Looking at where Yui is pointing, I see the gigantic Ferris wheel slowly rotates while showering in the light of the sunset.\nAnd I turn back to Yui and see her looking at the Ferris wheel in fascination.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_33@Actually, I've always been wanted to visit an amusement park. But I really didn't have a chance because I was too busy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_34@Then isn't it great today that you can fulfill that dream with this chance?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_35@Yes. Through this virtual show, I fulfilled my dream in the reality. It's just like the dream coming true.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_36@... Now the only thing left is to go on a Ferris wheel with a man I like.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_37@──What?! What does Yui mean? Could it be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_38@Yui finally turns around to look at me. Her cheeks are painted with rosy shyness while her eyes remain as pure as the new moon in the cloudless sky.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_39@Coach, could you help me... turn this virtuality into reality?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_4@Hehe, it's all thanks to everyone! My management company even arranged a program for it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_5@Oh? Could it be a program about going on a date with you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_6@Ping pong! Coach got it right at the first guess. How smart!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_7@... I said it because I thought it would be impossible. Yui, you're a super idol. Is it okay to just date people like that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_8@It's going to be a "virtual date."\nI'll interact with the camera as if I'm dating the audience in the stream.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P002_N_3_9@So... I want to ask Coach for a favor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_1@One peaceful afternoon...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_10@This is impressive. I thought someone bought it from a florist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_11@We all look up to Sis Nadeshiko. She is gentle, elegant, trustworthy... I hope I can become more like her some day!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_12@Exactly. I've learned a lot from her, too. Sis Nadeshiko is my role model!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_13@Look, Nadeshiko is so popular.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_14@Stop it, everyone! You are making me blush.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_15@Although every team is assigned a secretary from the host organization, there's a great discrepancy in these secretaries' abilities. We are all so lucky to have Nadeshiko with us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_16@Haha! I am the lucky one. Everyone here is so kind to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_17@I thought with my age, it'd be hard to make any friends here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_18@What are you talking about?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_19@Yeah! We are all friends here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_2@There wasn't any match that day, and everyone was taking advantage of the break to relax. The girls sprawled lazily on the couch in the lounge, occasionally chatting with each other in broken sentences.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_20@We're all jealous of your age!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_21@Well... thank you, everyone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_22@And to show my gratitude, I'll make everyone a cup of tea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_23@Great!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_24@That day, a few of us sat around the lounge, sipping on the aromatic tea that Nadeshiko had prepared for us. It was a truly peaceful afternoon, and we whiled away our time in relaxation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_25@Little did I know that the Nadeshiko we knew so well was just one side of her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_3@Only Nadeshiko was sitting alone, of to the side. She was attentively reading a book, and her elegant posture produced a calming effect on those who noticed her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_4@Nadeshiko, what are you reading?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_5@Ah, coach... This is a collection of essays entitled "Serene Flowers and Tea".
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_6@I actually quite enjoy flower arranging and tea ceremonies, so this book really caught my eye. I just had to buy it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_7@Wow, Nadeshiko! You must be very well-read.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_8@Nah, it's just one of my hobbies.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_1_9@Sis Nadeshiko is also an expert in flower arranging. Look! This bouquet was her work.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_1@Coach, I've prepared the balance sheet for this month. Please take a look.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_10@Hm... Would that be asking for too much?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_11@Of course not.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_12@In that case... Thank you in advance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_14@Well, if you'll excuse me, then...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_15@In the room...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_16@♪
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_17@As I walked past my room, I saw Nadeshiko sitting on the ground, folding my clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_18@She'd picked up all the clothes I'd scattered around in the dormitory, but I didn't expect her to do even more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_19@That must have been a lot of trouble. Why does she look so pleased?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_2@Wow... It's very detailed. I bet nothing can stump a professional secretary.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_20@Ah, coach. I've started organizing your clothes. I hope you don't mind...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_21@Well... don't say that. In fact, you are doing me a great favor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_22@But I do feel a bit... embarrassed. I feel like I'm being coddled like a small child.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_23@By the way, coach—I noticed there was a hole in your briefs...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_24@Still wearing that smile, Nadeshiko pulled out a pair of old briefs... and in place of the hole, she had sewn a patch with cute peach patterns.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_25@And I've fixed it for you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_26@Ahhh!! This has to stop!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_3@It's just simple paperwork.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_4@Nadeshiko smiled softly. She was a mature woman with a serene, elegant aura about her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_5@Right. Coach—I saw some of your clothes scattered around the dormitory...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_6@Oh. I must have left them without thinking about it as I was changing. I'll go pick them up later... Where did you see them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_7@Well... the changing room, the shower room, the laundry area, the balcony...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_8@Ahhh!!! So sorry about that! I'll run to pick them up right away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_2_9@Haha. I didn't mean to scold you. Would you like me to do it for you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_1@Uhhhhhh... Sis Nadeshiko, I'm so sorry... I broke your flower pot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_10@So I asked Nadeshiko out on a date and started implementing my plan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_11@Nadeshiko! Sorry I'm late.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_12@That's alright. I'm glad you made it. How about we start with something to drink?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_13@(I'm an hour late and she's not even slightly angry?! I'd better up my game...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_14@Okay. Thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_15@As Nadeshiko handed the menu over to me, I "accidentally" knocked over a bottle of water, spilling its contents all over her skirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_16@Sorry!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_17@It's okay. It's just water, and it will dry quickly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_18@(You can let that go, too? Stop being so lenient and just get angry with me!!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_19@That won't do. I'll have to unleash my final move!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_2@Ah... That's alright—as long you're not hurt, Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_20@You can't leave it like that. Let me wipe it clean for you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_21@I stood up from my chair and tried to wipe the water from Nadeshiko's skirt with my handkerchief. But I knocked one of the table legs and lost my balance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_22@(Damn! I actually fell down!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_23@It turned out faking it was a lot harder than I'd imagined. I actually lost my balance fell completely onto Nadeshiko.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_26@When the commotion settled down, my first sensation was the soft touch on my face, as if it was buried in sponges.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_27@Hm...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_28@To regain my balance, I reached out and managed to grab hold of something soft and warm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_29@Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_3@But Sis Nadeshiko, you made this pot yourself, and it was so beautiful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_31@I looked up and saw I was fondling Nadeshiko's breasts, where my face had landed just a moment ago.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_32@I'm so... so sorry!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_33@That's... alright.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_34@Nadeshiko blushed profusely. A sense of embarrassment gripped both of us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_35@I sat back in my chair in a stupefied manner, feeling the bite of remorse.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_36@(Look at where this experiment has led you...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_37@(But Nadeshiko didn't even get angry at me for touching her breasts... She is truly a woman with an embracing, compassionate heart.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_38@Nadeshiko lowered her head to clean up the water when she let out a little shriek.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_39@Damn! The water spilled onto my bag...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_4@I can make another one at any time. You could even help me with the next one. How does that sound, Yui?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_40@Is everything okay? Is something in your bag not waterproof?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_41@It should be fine...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_42@Nadeshiko wiped her bag clean and emptied its contents onto the table.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_43@An exquisite, handmade leather-bound book caught my eye. I had no idea what it could be for. It was a bit too thick to be a notebook.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_44@I flipped open the book out of curiosity, but Nadeshiko acted before I could see clearly what was written in it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_45@No!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_46@She panicked and snatched her book out of my curious hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_47@Coach, why would you just carelessly go through my private things?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_48@You are... angry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_49@I'm sorry…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_50@And with that awkward moment, my experiment finally ended.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_51@Nadeshiko carefully put her book away inside the bag. Her flustered manner aroused my suspicion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_52@(Maybe she has some secrets hidden away in that book?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_6@(Nadeshiko has the heart of a saint...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_7@(Come to think of it, she has always been kind to everyone. Does she ever get cross? I'm curious...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_8@So I've made up my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_3_9@I must find out what Nadeshiko's "trigger point" is!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_1@I'd been thinking about Nadeshiko's secret leather-bound book for some time, but couldn't get my hands on any further information.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_10@I see...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_11@I went silent.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_12@To say I'm not sad would be lying. But this is the regulation, and I'm beyond the age where I'd fight over something I'm not completely happy with.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_13@Well... It's been great to have you around. You've been a huge help.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_14@I have to thank you. I've had the best time here. Thank you, coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_15@Nadeshiko smiled softly, trying to hide the regret in her eyes. She bowed slightly and walked away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_16@As I watched her leave the room, I thought to myself:
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_17@(She's the perfect secretary, even through the last moment...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_18@Does being an adult mean you have to hide away your emotions?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_2@But that day, a sudden turn of events threw me for a loop, making me completely forget about that book...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_20@Time flew by, and soon it was Nadeshiko's last day with us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_21@Sis Nadeshiko, we'll miss you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_22@*Sob, sob*... Sis Nadeshiko...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_23@Don't cry, good girl. Everyone has to move on. This is an amazing team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_24@Um...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_25@It's the moment to say goodbye, but our coach is nowhere to be seen...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_26@He said he had to attend to some other matters. After all, there won't be a secretary for some time, and he's going to be quite busy. You have to be understanding.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_27@Well... Time to go. Take care, everyone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_28@Through my windows I saw Nadeshiko walk away. I sighed in resignation and sat back in my chair.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_29@I looked at the documents in my hand absentmindedly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_3@Nadeshiko, are you really leaving the team?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_30@Nadeshiko must have organized these. She likes to keep everything tidy and in order, and knows all the small habits I have.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_31@Will I ever find such a good secretary again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_32@And... she's more than just a secretary...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_33@I thought fondly of the various happenings between us—her smile and her embracing heart, the throbbing warmth of our colliding bodies...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_34@As I thought of everything that happened between Nadeshiko and me, the stirring in my heart was just another reminder that she was more than a secretary to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_35@Damn!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_36@I bolted from my chair and dashed out of the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_38@Akane shouted as I ran past the girls. I didn't have time to respond as I ran like mad out of the dormitory.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_39@I ran all the way to the station, finally spotting the figure I was looking for on the platform, boarding the train.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_4@I looked at the reassignment paper in my hand incredulously. Across the desk, Nadeshiko looked at me with a sad smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_40@...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_41@I was breathing so heavily that I couldn't utter a single word, so I grabbed her by the arm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_43@Coach...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_44@Na... Nadeshiko!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_45@I panted like a beast and couldn't muster up the strength to speak, my hand still firmly gripping Nadeshiko's arm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_46@Coach, did something happen?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_47@Nadeshiko looked at me with concern. She was always so caring.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_48@I raised my head and looked her straight in the eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_49@...Don't go. Stay with us!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_5@Yes. All secretary assignments have specific terms, and it is about time I leave.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_51@Nadeshiko was about to cry, but bit her lip and forced back her tears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_52@But... It's the rule...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_53@There must be a way! How can we know there isn't without giving it a try? I'll do whatever it takes until I get permission from the management! I must keep you with us!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_54@Nadeshiko looked at me in shock. Fearing her rejection, I went on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_55@You don't have to worry about it. Leave everything to me. All I'm asking is for you to stay!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_57@Nadeshiko was dumbfounded. But after a while, she broke into a resounding giggle.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_58@Damn it…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_59@You have always relied on me to help you, so I won't let you take care of everything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_6@But how will we manage all our secretarial tasks?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_60@...Are you trying to say I'm unreliable?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_61@No.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_62@Nadeshiko shook her head and gave me a gentle smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_63@I meant to say that we have to work together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_64@*Whoo, Whoooo!*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_65@The train was departing from the station.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_66@That day, I walked my secretary home.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_7@There will be another secretary, and I'll be reassigned somewhere else. Secretaries are term-based and relocated regularly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_8@But can't we just keep you here forever?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_4_9@It's regulation...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_1@It was a sunny and comfortable afternoon. The girls were having picnics in the yard. I was heading back to my room after lunch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_10@Aahh... Harder...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_11@Nadeshiko groaned with blurred eyes, as if she was picturing someone touching her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_12@Her pencil skirt was raised up, fully exposing her long legs and the crease of her buttocks. One of her hands was still stroking nimbly between her legs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_13@(Wow... I didn't realize that Nadeshiko could be like this...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_14@As a secretary, she was usually gentle and steady. This secret side of her was quite different and unexpected.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_15@I should have left right away, but Nadeshiko's mature and erotic breathing stirred up my masculine, primitive desire. I was completely frozen, unable to even move a step.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_16@I stared at Nadeshiko's hand between her legs. With her movement getting more intense, she couldn't help groaning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_17@Ah... Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_19@For a moment I thought Nadeshiko had seen me, but she didn't turn to look at me. She was still completely immersed in her own world.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_2@...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_20@Upon closer inspection, I saw that one of my shirts was under Nadeshiko's body. She leaned and arched her back as if she being held by me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_21@Ah... Coach... Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_22@Recognizing the full context of this scene, my desire suddenly spiked.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_23@Ah... Coach... Yes, right there.... More…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_24@Show me where.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_25@I pushed open the door and walked into the room. Nadeshiko gasped as if she'd woken up from a erotic dream.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_27@Nadeshiko tried to cover herself up, but she had no excuse for the messy scene. She looked shamefully at the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_28@I didn't realize that you were this kind of woman, Nadeshiko... You can get hot just from one of my shirts?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_3@As soon as I stepped into the empty ballroom, I could hear something strange.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_30@Don't apologize. Go ahead. Weren't you enjoying yourself? I'm here to watch. You should be more excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_31@I'm, I'm sorry…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_32@As Nadeshiko apologized, she still could not hold back the sexual desire already ignited in her body. Her hand started caressing her pussy again, while the other fondled her nipples.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_33@Uh, ah... Oh, yeah... Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_34@(Ah... She was watched by burning eyes...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_35@Recognizing that her every move was being watched as she touched her own pussy, Nadeshiko was driven by her own shame and fire-like pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_36@Mmm... Aaahhhh... Aahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_37@Nadeshiko shivered and strained. Her fingers felt a heat flow, and even her nipples were slightly wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_38@My God... I masturbated in front of my coach... My God…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_39@Nadeshiko was lying in bed, her clothes still askew, gasping for breath. Her pencil skirt and panties were all scrunched up, and her plump buttocks were now exposed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_4@Is there anyone here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_40@Clear and sticky liquid was running out of her hot pink pussy, sliding down the crack of her buttocks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_41@Well done... Let me give you a reward.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_42@I pressed my hard cock against her pussy and penetrated her before she could react.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_43@Aaahhh... Coach, your cock... is inside me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_44@Nadeshiko's pussy was hot and soft, as if it was ready to take in completely. It also contracted every time she trembled, as if it was trying to swallow my cock down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_45@(Too much... It's too good... I can't move my waist...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_46@I clenched my teeth and resisted the impulse to cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_47@Upon a closer look, Nadeshiko's eyes were glazed over, as if she was lost in another orgasm spurred by my penetration. Seeing her ludicrous expression, my sexual desire was aroused again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_48@You've been waiting for this for a long time, haven't you? Now let me make you feel really fucking good…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_49@I squeezed Nadeshiko's buttocks tight. Her plump cheeks were soft and heavy—well-suited for my strength.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_5@I followed the sounds into the room. The sound was very small, and seemed to come and go. I started wondering if my ears had played a trick on me, but then I recognized it was coming from Nadeshiko's room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_50@Aaaahhhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_51@With my penis deeper inside Nadeshiko's pussy, she raised her neck and groaned. After enjoying the pleasant sensation of being wrapped inside her, I started thrusting slowly and increasing speed incrementally.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_52@Nadeshiko groaned in a delicate voice. She uttered a seductive moan each time I thrust deeper inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_53@Aah... Aah... Aah... Aah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_54@Are you feeling comfortable? Were you thinking about while you were masturbating with my stuff?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_55@Ah, hmm, hmm... Yes, I was thinking about... your cock... Hmm, ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_56@Then this is a dream-come-true for you. You must be happy, right? You should take it well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_57@Yes, yes... Coach... fuck me, please... Mmm, ah, ah, ah—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_58@Every time I inserted violently, my body slapped against Nadeshiko's plump buttocks, emitting erotic pounding sounds.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_59@Her large breasts shook up and down with the movement of her body, triggering even more desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_6@The door of Nadeshiko's room was half closed. When I approached it, I saw Nadeshiko lying on the bed in her untidy clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_60@Well... I'm almost ready to cum…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_61@Cum... Cum in me! Give me your thick semen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_62@Nadeshiko shouted in spite of herself. She actively twisted her buttocks to match my movements, allowing my cock to push even deeper.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_63@Oh, no... You're pussy is sucking my cock in... Nadeshiko, you really are a cum collector... You just accept with your body!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_64@Aaahhhhhhhh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_65@Nadeshiko reached orgasm screaming—something she had never had before. She was drowned in the mind-numbing pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_66@Feeling the tightness of her pussy, I could not help but shoot all my semen into the depths of her pussy. Her pussy tightened up even more, accepting every drop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_67@Haa... Ha... Ha...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_68@While Nadeshiko caught her breath, I pulled out my cock, creating a transparent liquid thread linking my shaft to her pussy. No sperm had leaked out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_69@Ah... I collected it all…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_7@I thought that I had accidentally caught Nadeshiko changing her clothes, but before I turned to leave, I heard an erotic groan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_70@Nadeshiko felt the heat of my cum inside her body and smiled.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h1_9@Her blouse were unbuttoned and pulled up, exposing her round and plump breasts. Her thin fingers were caressing and squeezing her chest tightly, warping her soft mounds.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_1@I accidentally saw the hand-bound book when I was sorting through the luggage that had been carried back to the dormitory.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_10@This... That's…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_11@Nadeshiko looked at the ground, lost for words. I approached her and handed her the book.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_12@I'm very interested in your creation. Let's treat this as a play that we can act out together, OK?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_13@Nadeshiko hands trembled as she took the book back. Her eyes fell to the pages and her cheeks turned red. She answered in a soft voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_14@Okay...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_16@According to the content of the book, Nadeshiko removed all her clothes and stood in front of the mirror.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_17@She could fully see her naked and exposed figure, and spotted his burning eyes in the corner of the room. Although Nadeshiko was shy, her face was full of anticipation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_18@Like this... OK, coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_19@Why do you ask me? Isn't it your work? Just read it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_2@Nadeshiko?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_21@Nadeshiko's eyes went back to the page of her erotic writing. She read in a trembling voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_22@...His body pressed against her from behind, and then he crudely kneaded her breasts…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_23@I couldn't help but lean over and cup her full breasts, as if her voice was seducing and enthralling me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_24@My fingertips sunk into her soft, plump chest. I coveted this feeling, and could not help but press and knead it firmly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_26@Go on, please.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_27@...He kneaded her nipples between his thumb and forefinger, sending sensations like electric shocks through her body... Oh! No...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_28@Why not? Didn't you write it? This is what you want. Go on. Don't stop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_29@Oh, yeah... She, she suppressed a gasp... Hmm... as her body, body was stimulated…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_3@I called her name just to make sure she wasn't nearby. Good! It was the perfect opportunity to read!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_30@Her pussy ached with heat... Longing for his touch...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_31@I was guided by what Nadeshiko read. One of my hands reached between her plump buttocks to touch her hot pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_32@Ah—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_33@Hmm... Sure enough, her pussy was totally wet. Nadeshiko continued pinching her own breasts. Does she like breast stimulation that much?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_34@I, ah... Coach... I can't keep reading... like this…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_35@If you don't read, I will stop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_36@I flipped to a new page at random.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_37@Read here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_38@Ah... Her body was so hot from his caress. He pressed her against the wall...Mm—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_39@Both Nadeshiko and I knew what would happen next. As she was pressed against the wall, she looked back at me with entranced eyes. She read as if she was in a dream...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_4@I flipped through it, and the themes throughout the pages made me quickly understand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_40@...He ran through her with his hot, hard, huge penis... Uh-ah-ah-ah—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_41@As she wished, I drove my actual cock into her wet and hot pussy. Nadeshiko cried out at once.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_42@Ah—! The sensation from his rubbing on her pussy made her scream... Oh, yeah... It's too good... I can't stand it... My mind is going blank...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_43@For a while, we forgot to read. Just like wild animals, we attacked each other, lost in waves of pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_44@Ah... Oh, yeah... Ah, ah, ah... Uh, ah, ah, ah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_45@Nadeshiko groaned in a loud voice, and she could hardly hold the notebook on her hands anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_46@Nadeshiko... wants his penis for real... Which is better?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_47@I asked this maliciously as I hit her G-spot over and over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_48@Oh, yeah... Penis... penis... The real penis is the best...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_49@That's right. Since you've been thinking about my cock for a long time, Nadeshiko... I'll satisfy you properly now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_5@This, this…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_50@I held Nadeshiko's plump body tight and thrust into her again and again. She shivered with excitement, spilling lewd words from her full lips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_51@Her pussy tightened to make the perfect form around his penis... Ah, ah, ah... Great—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_52@Nadeshiko, you really like this cock. Just my cock can make you crazy like this…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_53@Oh, yeah... I like... like... think about your cock every hour, every second…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_54@Oh, yeah... Coach... Stir in my body with your cock. Let me reach orgasm!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_55@Let me fulfill you sexually in both dream and reality. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_56@Oh... I'm cumming—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_57@Emitting erotic pounding sounds, my hot semen shot deep into her pussy. We were both in a trance, our minds blank from orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_58@Ah, ah, ah... Ah... You are the best…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_59@Nadeshiko continued to tremble. The book on her hands slipped onto the ground, dropping into a pool of our juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_6@This was a sex novel written by Nadeshiko herself. And the protagonists were her and me…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_7@Coach, don't take anything out of the trunk. I'll do it later... Ah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_8@Nadeshiko walked into the room and immediately saw the hand-bound book in my hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_h2_9@Nadeshiko, have you always fancied these things?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_1@Ah~ Even I'm exhausted. Coach is a demon!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_10@I crack the door open and see Alice lying on Nadeshiko's thighs, constantly letting out lazy moans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_11@Uhmm~ Yes~ Right there~ Are you actually the light goddess of life's priestess in disguise? This numbness of muscle recovering...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_12@I'm glad that I can help.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_13@(So it was... massaging? I almost freaked out...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_14@Nadeshiko sis can remain so elegant when we're all worn out... Is it because you've learned tea ceremony and flower arrangement?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_15@Maybe. But I would also have pain in my back or waist at the beginning of my training. That's why I learned some massaging skills to relax my muscles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_16@Nadeshiko sis... How impressive... I hope I can be shining like you one day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_17@But... is it even possible...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_18@It's all about sticking to it. If Fuuko is interested, I have a small technique to achieve it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_19@Is, is that true?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_2@Today's training was really tough. But that's the key to swift improvement.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_20@Yes. Come closer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_22@──Eh? What?! Th-this is... too embarrassing. I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_23@Don't you want to try it? It works very well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_25@(What on earth is the technique? Why is Fuuko's face as red as a tomato?...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_26@I can't help opening the door a little bit wider. Never would I expect that Nadeshiko raises her head at this very moment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_27@(She, she saw me! Crap! They'll think I'm a pervert! Then how can I maintain my dignity as the coach of the team──)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_28@Oh, I forgot that this technique works better in the water. Why don't we head to the hot spring first?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_29@Yeaaaaaah! I've been waiting for so long already! Go go go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_3@Everyone must have a hard time today. Do you want to enjoy a hot bath in the bathhouse together?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_31@The girls all head to the hot spring behind the changing room. After everyone has left, Nadeshiko turns back and looks at me, who is still standing behind the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_33@She slightly raises her finger and places it on her luscious lips. Silently and flirtatiously, she makes a "shh" pose to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_34@──And, leaving me transfixed there with my heart beating fast, she turns around and enters the hot spring.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_4@I approve!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_6@Phew~ It's no picnic to be a coach── Hm? Why is there a new door?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_7@Oh, right. I heard that the boss had built a hot spring bathhouse in the dorm as a reward for our team...\nWhich means... this should be the door to the changing room, where should be connected to the hot spring.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_8@Ah... Umm~ Uhhmm~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_1_9@What's that weird sound?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_1@It is said that a horse merchant has come to Star City. He even built a field for citizens to experience horseback riding.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_10@Nadeshiko?! Well, I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_11@Um, you looked a little bit strange when they were talking about horses. Is everything okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_12@Maybe I was just thinking about the shopping list for groceries. I'm so sorry about it. How can I make Coach misunderstand me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_13@You don't have to apologize. It's just...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_14@Ah, it's time for the limited sale. I should go there now. Coach, please rest well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_15@... She did look strange. She didn't even make any eye contact with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_16@Hm? There's something in the laundry basket... Isn't this Nadeshiko's journal?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_17@Let's see... "On the bumping horseback, his shoulder was the only stableness I could rely on. His arms tightly surrounded my fluttering heart."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_18@Is this a novel Nadeshiko writes? From her words, she seems to long for horseback riding...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_19@... Alright!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_2@Really? I've never ridden a horse before.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_21@Is this the place?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_22@I have no idea what Coach is up to.\nHe just left a note to me and asked me to meet him here, with no clue about what we will be doing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_23@... It's right next to the horseback riding field here. I can see the horses so closely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_24@Just when Nadeshiko was peeking into the horse field, some strong force strikes against the back of her waist. The hot and wet texture makes her scream.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_25@Wha-what?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_26@Hey! Don't! Why is this horse as naught as my team members?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_27@Coach? On a... horse?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_28@While Nadeshiko is spacing out looking at me riding a horse, I try my best to control the horse and answer,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_29@You want to be on a horseback, don't you? Instead of wri-writing about it in your novel, you sh-should experience it yourself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_3@Humph, horse? As someone possessing magic ability, I won't be satisfied riding such an ordinary creature──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_30@...! So... you were the one who picked up my book...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_31@I'm sorry to read it without your consent. But there's something I want you to know.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_32@Even though I'm not good at riding a horse, if I can make my hardworking secretary a little bit happier...\nI'll do my best to fulfill all your fantasies.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_33@──So, no matter what you're thinking about, you can just tell me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_34@... That will be too willful if I do so.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_35@Nadeshiko murmurs with a cherishable gentle expression. She reaches her hand out towards me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_36@Thank you for granting me such rights, Coach.\nNow, please gallop with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_5@Hm? Nadeshiko?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_6@She walked away... Maybe I should follow her for how weird she looked before leaving.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_8@Where did she go...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_2_9@Coach? Why are you in the laundry room?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_1@—I don’t want to leave this team and I want you understand that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_10@I lie down on my desk, feeling that my energy and soul are slowly flowing out from my mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_11@For some reason I don't know, Nadeshiko suddenly joined Kagano's "Team Operation Supervising Squad," which elevated my already horrible workload to a lava-like situation that I can neither swallow nor digest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_12@(... I'm so sleepy...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_13@I start to space out.\nNot sure it's in my dream or reality, a fragrant jacket was softly placed on my back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_14@... I'm sorry for making it so tough for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_15@A few days later.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_16@Wha-what?! The chairman is at the door?! Nobody told me he's coming!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_17@It seems to be a sudden visit. All of us are surprised... I've brought him to the living room to have a seat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_18@Sigh... I got it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_2@She must stay here because player said so. But the person on the other side reacts more intensely than she expected.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_20@Long time no see. Hope I'm not disturbing your holiday.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_21@You'll never be! I wonder what brings Chairman here...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_22@I'll stop beating around the bush then. Somebody is so confident about your leadership in the team that I'm very curious about it. I only have one question for you: Do you have the confidence to make your team the world champion?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_23@Ah, yes. I'll do my best to develop the potential of each member!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_24@He, as I expected, it's only about unrealistic belief. If you don't have any practical plan, I don't think I should stay any longer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_25@──Please wait a minute!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_26@Thinking of the works Nadeshiko assigned me these days, I start to analyze our opponents' abilities, the team's advantages, and my training plans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_27@So that's how it is. Looks like you really are a promising coach. Am I right, Nadeshiko?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_28@Nadeshiko? Why did you suddenly come in?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_29@I'll agree with you to stay here and continue assisting him. But don't forget that the result is the most powerful weapon for negotiation.\nI'll take my leave now and keep observing this team afterwards.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_3@Listen to me, daddy! The call ended...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_30@... Thank you, father.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_31@Fa-father?! So Nadeshiko is the chairman's daughter? So what she did these days was actually training for me to win his father's recognition, so that she can stay by my side...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_32@I walk towards Nadeshiko and put my arm around her shoulder, seeing the chairman leaving together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_33@Nadeshiko, what you have done will not become a waste. Let's work hard together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_34@Yes, Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_4@Staring at the cellphone she just hung up, Nadeshiko looks upset.\nBut soon, she puts back the firm expression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_6@Recently, I've been living in hell.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_7@Coach, I've placed the data analysis here. Please read it.\nAnd the report yesterday still needs some improvement. Please spare some time for it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_8@I... I can't...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P003_N_3_9@Coach?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_1@So this is Star City... and Coach lives here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_10@Does player live around here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_11@player? Oh... He moved somewhere else.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_12@What...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_13@He has to lead his team in the tournaments, so he moved into the dormitory. You could go ask for him there... Miss? Where did you go, miss?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_14@Coach isn't home, but that's alright. Saki will look for him in the streets. Saki will find him!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_15@The young woman had made up her mind, and she walked down the streets still clutching her doll.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_17@What should I do...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_18@She'd spent the better half of a day wandering the streets. The sun was setting and she still hadn't found the right person.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_19@Saki has come all the way to the city to find Coach... but Coach is not here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_2@A young woman with a doll in her arms walked out of the station. She looked around anxiously, her small body almost buried in the thick throng of people moving about.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_20@The young woman came to a park and sat down on a swing, her head and her doll dangling in frustration.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_21@Hey, miss? What are you doing here all by yourself?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_22@!!!\nCoach!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_23@...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_24@I was quite surprised that she seemed to recognize me, as I was just a stranger offering to help this lost young lady.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_25@Hm... I think maybe you have me confused with the person you're looking for?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_26@Coach player! Saki hasn't got the wrong Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_27@This girl, Saki, spoke confidently as she revealed a photo in her hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_28@That can't be... Is this really a photo of myself and this woman when she was younger?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_29@The photo was taken at a primary school in the countryside. Come to think of it, when I was attending the university, I once joined a camp that taught groups of children in a remote village.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_3@I'm not scared... Saki has gone all the way from home in order to see Coach... Saki has to be brave!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_30@...But I had no recollection of this girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_31@The woman standing before me looked a few years older than in the photo, and was staring at me desperately with her big, watery eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_32@Coach was the first person to be so kind to Saki, and gave Saki this doll!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_33@Saki is grown up now, so Saki has come here to do something for Coach in return!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_34@Hm... I'm moved by that, but you don't really have to thank me. Let me walk you home now, okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_35@Saki... has no place to go...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_36@She dropped her head pitifully. I realized she had wanted a warm reunion with the chance to thank me, but she was still so young and naive. She must be heartbroken from the difference between her expectations and reality.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_37@...Well, you can come home with me, then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_38@Really? That's great! Saki can do everything! Cooking, cleaning, washing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_39@I think you've got me wrong. I'm not looking for a housekeeper...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_4@She grabbed her doll tightly to give herself some courage, and started walking in large strides.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_40@Saki beamed radiantly at me. Her smile was contagious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_41@...Oki-doki. Let's go home.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_5@Outside a residential area...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_6@Excuse me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_7@Hm? Who's there? (looking around)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_1_9@Oh. It's you. What is it, miss?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_1@...Why are all these things scattered around in the doorway?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_10@One afternoon, during the holiday break...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_11@I'm exhausted... If I keep Saki in the dormitory, she'll destroy the place in a single day! \nI'd better take her away on an excursion... That's the smart move.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_12@What's taking you so long, Saki?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_13@Coach, sorry for keeping you waiting!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_14@Saki?! Why are you dressed up like that?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_15@Saki was wearing a strappy tank top, shorts, and a pair of kitty ears on her head. She did look cute in that outfit, but it made her look so young that it was weird!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_16@Sis Rina said that Coach would like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_17@No, no, no, no... Go back and get changed right now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_18@Sir, is this young lady with you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_19@...Yes... But we're not related...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_2@Saki is helping with grocery shopping today...! Saki can carry this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_20@Could you come with me to the station, please?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_21@Listen... Let me explain... Ahhhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_23@...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_24@I collapsed on the couch in the dormitory, covering my face in my hands. Rina had fished me out of the police station, and now she stood there giggling cruelly at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_25@Saki sat off to the side, clearly dismayed. Her kitty ears had been removed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_26@Rina, why would you manipulate her like that? You think it's funny?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_27@Actually, it is... Heeheehee!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_29@Saki... Saki only wants to make Coach happy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_3@You'd better leave it to me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_30@Saki…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_31@I patted her head fondly as she continued to look sadly at the floor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_32@Don't worry about what happened, Saki. You just have a lot to learn about adulthood. I can see that you have a good heart, and I know you just want to help.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_33@Saki raised her head and looked at me with her big, sparkling eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_35@Yes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_36@Hearing my words of consolation, Saki's face lit up. Her high spirits were back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_37@Great! Saki will work harder!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_38@...Actually, you don't really have to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_39@Oh, well... Keep up the good work, Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_4@Uh... Why is there so much water on the table?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_40@Saki gave me a radiant smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_5@Saki is cleaning up the table today!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_7@How did all my clothes in the closet end up in the laundry basket?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_8@Saki is cleaning up Coach's room today!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_2_9@Saki, I beg you—please leave all of that to me!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_1@It was pouring rain that day...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_10@Sa... Saki... is alright!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_11@Saki's voice was up an octave, and she looked incredibly flustered. To believe what she said would be an insult to my intelligence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_12@I... I see.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_13@But I'd better just go along with what she says.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_14@Well, I've still got some paperwork to do. We can't do any training today, so you can loaf around while I'm away, Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_15@Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_16@Saki watched in distress as player walked away. She tried to say something, but couldn't find the words.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_17@Saki was now all alone in the corridor. She held her doll tightly, looking at the somber sky outside the windows.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_18@Saki is not scared... not scared...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_2@Through the windows, I could see the dark clouds hanging in the sky. Heavy storms had drenched the whole city in an expanse of water and fog.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_20@Yaaahhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_21@Saki scurried into the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_23@The rain continued until midnight. Ominous, growling sounds reverberated through the low-hanging clouds. The built-up charges would be unleashed at any moment now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_24@Saki laid in bed and covered her head with a quilt, holding her doll tightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_25@Saki... is not scared...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_26@She kept mumbling these words of self-reassurance, but every time there was a thunderclap, she shook under her quilt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_27@Uuuuuh…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_28@Just as she was about to burst into tears, she heard a knock on the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_29@Saki, may I come in?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_3@Yeah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_30@Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_31@Saki jumped out of bed and opened the door for player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_32@You're still awake, Saki?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_33@Saki forced down her tears and nodded, her eyes still red from crying.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_34@...Yeah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_35@Are you afraid of the thunder?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_36@Saki... is not afraid!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_39@Saki jumped up in fear. I stroked her head to calm her down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_4@Saki came over to the window to observe the dark storm clouds with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_40@Will it be better if I stay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_41@Hm... Maybe it'll be less scary...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_42@In that case, I'll stay with you, Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_43@I held her hand and led her to her bed. She clambered back under the covers as I sat down at the foot of her bed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_44@Saki curled up and looked at me with startled eyes. She reached out her petite hand and clasped my wrist tightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_45@Saki, can we make a deal?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_46@What?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_47@You don't have to be strong in front of me. Just be yourself. You can show your inexperience and fears as much as you want.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_48@Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_49@Under the lamp light, Saki looked at me with her twinkling eyes, like two little stars sparkling in the night sky.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_5@*Boom...*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_50@Yes. Saki will make this deal with Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_51@Good. Now go to sleep. I'll stay here with you, Saki. Good night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_52@Alright!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_53@Saki closed her eyes, and a smile of happiness lingered at the corner of her mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_54@Good night, Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_6@There was a sudden flash of lightning in the sky, followed by a deafening and reverberating thunderclap.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_7@Eeeeek!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_8@Saki jumped up like a startled kitten.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_3_9@That was a big one... Hm? Saki, are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_1@Saki stood in front of the coach's office. She stared at the doorknob, but couldn't bring herself to open the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_10@) ! @ ( # * ! ) ( ( * @ ... !
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_11@What did you just say?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_12@Saki mustered up all the strength in her tiny body and shouted at the top of her voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_13@Saki likes Coach!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_14@This was immediately followed by an awkward silence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_15@Hm... What just happened?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_16@Well... At a time like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_17@I scratched my head. After giving it some thought, I spoke in a calm voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_18@Uh... Saki... I like you, too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_19@Not like that!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_2@Saki... will be brave.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_20@Saki snapped back in anger. I was quite frightened by her reaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_22@Saki is serious. Don't treat her like a child!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_23@Coach played with Saki when no one else talked to me, and gave Saki the first present...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_24@She held her doll tightly in her arms as she said this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_25@She looked like she was about to burst into tears, but I was touched by her sincerity and chose not to interrupt her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_26@It's because of Coach's kindness that Saki decided to come all the way to Star City.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_27@Because Coach have been so nice and helpful to Saki, Saki has the motivation to keep working this hard!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_28@No one can replace Coach for Saki, as he is the most important person in my life! Saki doesn't want Coach to treat me like a child!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_29@She began to choke on her tears, but still managed to finish her sentence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_3@She mumbled to herself, her eyes burning with determination.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_30@Seeing her cry, I realized that perhaps confronting one's own emotions is enough bring tears sometimes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_31@But Saki was very brave. Even though she knew very little, she still traveled to an unfamiliar city all by herself. Now she was brave enough to confess her true feelings.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_32@She was such a pure, innocent soul.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_33@...Okay. I understand. Sorry, Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_34@I can see how serious you are about this, and I shouldn't have answered so casually... I'm sorry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_35@That's alright. Saki only wanted to Coach to know...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_36@Yeah... I get it now. You're doing great, Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_37@Yes. Saki has done a good job!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_38@She nodded and finally stopped holding back her tears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_39@Well... As a reward for you, Saki... I'd like to give you this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_4@That's it, Saki has made the decision to not run away. After all... it's Coach who taught Saki to be honest with herself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_40@I took out a paper bag from my desk drawer and handed it over to Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_41@What is this...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_42@Saki pulled reached into the bag and pulled out a beautiful kimono.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_43@You've said that you've always wanted to see a firework festival, right? Let's go to one together sometime.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_44@Saki looked at my mysterious smile incredulously, and then turned to look at the kimono. She couldn't decide what to say.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_45@Take it as a reward. You've been doing great, Saki... and I've seen your progress.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_46@Saki looked at me with her sparkling eyes and broke into a radiant, blissful smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_47@...Yes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_5@Saki made up her mind and opened the door with a bang.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_6@Ah... Saki? What's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_7@I was taken back by the sight of Saki, who looked more like a debt collector as she barged into the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_8@Coach! Saki... has something to tell you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_4_9@Alright. What is it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_1@Alas…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_10@Sis Rina told me that  it  would be a nice "service" to give you a bath, as  you would  enjoy it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_11@Don't listen to Rina about any kind of「service」…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_12@Oh... Then Saki can't help Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_13@Saki's eyes glistened with tears. I could only surrender to her expression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_14@All right... Saki, sit down here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_15@I patted my thighs, instructing Saki  to sit on my lap.  Saki's face had obvious shyness and hesitation, but in the end she managed to resist embarrassment and responded in a trembling voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_16@I... I know…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_17@Saki sat on my lap with her back turned me. Her body was light and petite. We were close enough to feel each other's body heat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_18@Coach... This feels strange… and yet so nice...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_19@Saki, relax. Come on, massage here for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_2@I raised my head so that the hot water from the shower could drown out my exhaustion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_20@My cock lifted towards Saki's legs and touched the inside of her soft thighs. Her tender skin pressed inward, and she looked particularly sexually excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_21@Oh, yes... Coach's cock…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_22@Saki flushed and stared at my cock as if I had turned on a switch in her mind for sexual exploration. Her petite face was full of curiosity and longing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_23@Saki stretched out her delicate hand and trembled as she stroked the head of my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_24@Saki, I think you know what this is. Yes, this is the only service I desire of you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_25@My cock pressed against Saki's pussy. I gently raised my hips, and Saki emitted a soft groan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_26@Oh, yeah... Ah... Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_27@You see, we can enjoy each other's bodies. Touching and holding each other is the ultimate service.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_28@I slowly moved my waist up and down. The triangular space marking where Saki's pussy met her soft inner thighs was almost intoxicating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_29@I unconsciously sped up, and Saki groaned with an increasingly-higher pitch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_3@Really... If only Saki  had been more aware…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_30@Ah... It's so good... Coach, are you also... Feeling great?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_31@As I thrusted against her, the head of my cock rubbed back and forth against the petals of her pussy. It was exhilarating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_33@I pounded between Saki's legs, holding her petite body in place. The scene we were making was like a pleasureful assault on her whole body, which excited us both.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_34@Haaa... Haaa... Haa... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_35@With my cock continuously pressing against her pussy, Saki was completely engrossed in pleasure, which she showed from her hot sweat and sexy groans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_36@Aahhh... Haaa... Haaa... Haaa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_37@Saki groaned in a trembling voice. Her small mouth gaped open so wide that it looked like she couldn't shut it, and drops of drool trickled from the corner of her lips onto my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_38@Saki... Saki feels so strange... Something seems to be coming...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_39@The transparent precum beading at the head of my cock mixed with Saki's pussy juices, lubricating my shaft and the petals of her pussy. Erotic pounding and slapping sounds were made each time I thrust against her pussy lips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_4@In return for a gift I gave a few years ago, Saki traveled alone to find me in the city. With nowhere else to go, she was now staying in my house.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_40@Uh, ah, ah... Oh, yeah... Saki wants it all! Uh, ah, ah, ah—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_41@I felt a the heat of Saki's juices trickling down the crack of her buttocks, and I couldn't help but cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_42@Hmph...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_43@A full load of cum erupted from my cock. It was so violent that some of my semen sprayed onto Saki's petite face. Saki's abdomen was completely covered in cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_44@Coach's semen... smells nice…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_45@Saki seemed in a trance as she felt the warmth of my potent seed on her cheeks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_46@I aimed my cock toward her and released every last drop of cum onto Saki's body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_47@Saki, you did a good job. I'll certainly ask for your services again soon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_48@Saki looked down at her body, covered in sperm, and her eyes sparkled.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_5@Although she was eager to help, she caused a variety of catastrophes because of her lack of knowledge. She caused an overflow of soap bubbles from the washing machine, a small flood from the sink water, and the list goes on... I was really curious how she was able to trigger so much chaos.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_6@Click—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_7@I heard the bathroom door open just as I was thinking about how to politely ask Saki not to "help" so much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_8@When I turned towards the door, I saw Saki standing naked in front of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h1_9@Saki?! What are you doing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_1@As promised, I brought Saki to the fireworks she'd always wanted to see, as reward for her hard work.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_10@It's like... When Coach  touches Saki... my body... especially there... gets  hot…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_11@I'm sorry. Saki is a bad girl... I can't help thinking of weird things…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_13@I did not utter a word, but led Saki quickly quickly off into the woods by the river.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_14@Huh, huh?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_15@Saki leaned back against a tree and looked at me in bewilderment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_16@Don't move. I'll check.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_17@I lifted one of Saki's legs and extended my hand into her kimono, touching her tender thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_19@Saki  shivered and shyly shifted her body upward, but she did  not  resist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_2@As we walked toward the river where the fireworks would be set off, the crowd grew more turbulent.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_20@My hand moved quickly between Saki's legs and gently stroked the hill of her slit over her panties.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_21@It's hot, isn't it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_22@Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_23@My fingers could tell that her panties were wet, and I lost control. I rudely stripped off her kimono.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_24@Well, uh…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_25@Saki closed her eyes and endured my rudeness, but when she felt my cock press against her, she couldn't help trembling and moaning in pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_26@The head of my cock pushed the seam of Saki's wet panties aside, immediately pressing against her wet and hot pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_27@It was wet and hot... as if her pussy was almost ready to accept my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_28@I gently twisted back and forth. My cock rubbed the front of her pussy. Saki could not help but groan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_29@Well, ah... Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_3@To avoid losing Saki in the crowd, I put my arm around her shoulder. I could feel her tiny body quivering, as if she was very frightened.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_30@Saki was almost paralyzed, but she pressed her body against my cock with more enthusiasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_31@Erotic sounds came from our bodies rubbing so closely together. Her pussy juices flowed onto my shaft until it was soaked.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_32@Wow... Saki's vaginal fluids were continuously flowing. She was even more sensitive than last time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_33@Ah... Ah... It's hot and hard... It feels so good…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_34@Uh, ah, ah... Saki is going to...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_35@No.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_36@Seeing me suddenly stop moving, Saki showed an expression of doubt and desire. The sensation of my cock pressed so close against her pussy made all of Saki's senses go crazy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_37@Oh, yaah...!  Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_38@I've made you wait so long already, Saki. I have double compensation for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_39@I straightened my waist, and my cock slipped into her tight opening.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_4@Saki, are you okay? Are you feeling uncomfortable?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_40@Ah—Coach... Yes, come inside... Ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_41@Though her pussy was very tight, it remarkably accepted the full length of my shaft all in one thrust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_42@Uh, ah, ah...! Ah... Coach... Saki can't control her voice…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_43@Saki's voice sounded like a plea for mercy. After all, the firework-watching crowd was just across the bushes, and someone might notice us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_44@But I just ignored her. I slowly moved my hips, gradually accelerating and using more power with my movement.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_45@Mm, hmm... Hmm... Hmm, ha, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_46@You said you wanted to see fireworks, but now you're taking my cock against a tree. You were already wet when I entered you... Saki, you've wanted this all along, haven't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_47@Ah, ah, I'm sorry... Ah... Saki is a bad girl... Oh, yeah... Ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_48@I was pounding with a punitive force. Her juices were already recklessly overflowing. The pounding sounds of our sex were getting louder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_49@(I can't... It's so good... I can't stand it...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_5@I'm sorry, Coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_50@Saki's small face was flushed. Her snow-white breasts were exposed by her disheveled kimono, showing how stiff her tiny nipples were. The sexy exposure of her body made me thrust even harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_51@(Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm... I'm... I'm coming...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_52@Her pussy tightened and contracted, stimulating my cock. Forgetting our surroundings, I rammed my cock into her pussy with all my strength.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_53@Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_54@Saki couldn't help groaning loudly. Her groan was only masked by the sound of erupting fireworks in the night sky.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_55@I couldn't help but cum into the depths of her pussy. Saki trembled a few times and groaned again as a second wave of climax washed over her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_56@Aahhh... Haaa... Haaa... Haaa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_57@The kimono was only half-covering Saki's body now, exposing most of her naked figure. Saki's naked body was covered in my cum and her pussy juices, making her look even more sexy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_58@I'm really enjoying the fireworks. Thank you, Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_59@Saki was in a trance from the aftershock of her orgasm. She did not respond. My cum oozed slowly out of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_6@You don't have to apologize.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_7@No... Coach is so gentle.  Saki  is really happy... But... I'm so happy... that I worry things are going to be weird now…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_8@Weird?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_h2_9@In response to my confused look, she answered with a voice as small as a gnat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_1@So, you want to know how to make player happy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_10@Come on in... Eh? Saki? With a cup of tea in your hand?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_11@Y-Yes, Coach, please enjoyyyyyy──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_12@Saki is about to fall after stepping out, but a strange power pulls her back to the standing position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_13@My balance maintenance device... is working!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_14@What?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_15@It's a device developed by Miss Rise and me that avoid people from tumbling.\nThis way, I can hand food and drinks to Coach without causing any trouble!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_16@You've worked so hard just for me... Thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_17@I reach out my hand to pat on Saki's head. She replied with an innocent smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_18@To make Coach even happier, Saki will try her best! Including learning how to serve Coach afterwards.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_19@I almost spit out the tea in my mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_2@Yes. Rina said that Misako sis knew a lot about it and asked me to come to you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_20@But seeing how innocent she looks, Saki has probably misunderstood the meaning of the word when she learned it...\nMaybe I should keep Saki around me to prevent her mind from being polluted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_3@I do know a lot of ways to please men, such as serving them...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_4@Serve?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_5@What are you talking about?! Don't teach her such things! If you want to make stupid player happy, just hand him some tea!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_6@But I might tumble on the way...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_7@Then try hard to overcome it! C'mon now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_8@Oh~ She's taken away. What a pity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_1_9@Knock knock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_1@I promised Saki to watch the fireworks together tonight, so I'm waiting for her in front of a vendor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_10@So sweet... It's delicious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_11@You seem to really like it, seeing how you're staining your cheek with it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_12@What?! Whe-Where?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_13@Don't move. I'll do it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_14@I gently wipe off the candy sticking on Saki's face with my finger and put it in my mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_15@Hm, it's really delicious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_16@... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_17@With her head down, Saki dared not look at me, but in the dim light I could see that her ears had become red and hot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_18@Suddenly, along with some booms, the night was illuminated by gaudy lines and dots. Saki raises her head and watches it in surprise.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_19@It's beautiful! So these are fireworks...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_2@Borther~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_20@Do you like it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_21@Yes! And, since I'm watching it with Coach... I like it mo-more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_22@I hold Saki's hand in my, looking at the fireworks reflected in her eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_23@Then let's come to watch it together from now on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_3@There you are── Hmm? Why aren't you wearing the kimono I gave you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_4@Because it's crowded in the festival and I'm afraid to stain it... Since it's a present from Coach, I want to cherish it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_5@Then... how about putting it on and show it to me after we go home?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_7@I pat on Saki's head and give her a stick of candy fruits.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_8@I just bought it for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_2_9@Ah, thank you, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_1@Here's your package. Please sign here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_10@Saki, how about massaging my shoulder for me? There's a method that I've been wanting to try.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_11@S-Sure! Coach, please teach me how to do it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_13@Can I really do it like this...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_14@Saki is light, so no problem~ Now step on me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_15@I lie prone on the bed, teaching Saki how to massage me with her toes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_16@Yes yes yes! There! Ah~ It feels so good~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_17@That's great! Oh, and I remember there's another way of massage...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_18@After the feeling of her tiny feet left my back, I feel some soft texture on my neck, as Saki is gently rubbing it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_19@(Ahhh... I'm going to fall asleep...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_2@Why is there still another one... Who on earth ordered so many energy drinks?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_20@Saki is just so considerate. Thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_21@Because you are Coach... If it's for Coach, I'm willing to do a-anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_3@It's... it's me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_4@Saki?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_5@Coach... looks tired recently, so I want to cheer Coach up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_6@So that's how it is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_7@But... it seems like I'm causing trouble for Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_8@It's not that severe... but my shoulder does feel sore after carrying so many packages.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P004_N_3_9@Sob... I'm sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_1@Is there anyone at home? Ah, Miss Tomoka. I'm player, the team coach. Could you please open the door?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_10@Er...! Please, get up and look me in the eyes if you have something to say. Otherwise, I'll have to call the police!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_11@I was about ready to fall on my knees when the couple finally stood up and chattered on about their problem.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_12@We have an only daughter. We don't know why she doesn't like going out. She stays in her room every day…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_13@She's over marriageable age. If she goes on like this, she'll end up aging alone in her room for life! We're really worried!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_14@So we want her to join your team, and hope you could train her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_15@Please! Any kind of training will do for her, even if she must serve as a janitorial aid!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_16@...Er... We're in the middle of a tournament…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_17@If you don't promise, we won't get up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_18@I get it! Get up! Get up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_19@So I came to Tomoka's home in an attempt at a good deed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_2@I tapped on the door of the room for ten minutes without a response.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_20@But no matter how long I knocked on the door of her room, it remained closed. I finally started to lose my patience.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_21@Miss Tomoka, your parents said that I could open the door. I don't want to just barge in... but it seems there's no other way. I'm going in!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_22@I made up my mind to just push the door open.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_23@Well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_24@What... What a dump! I couldn't see the floor of the room, which was filled with empty bottles and wrinkled clothes. I couldn't even find the girl amongst all the chaos of her messy room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_25@Miss Tomoka?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_26@When I raised my voice and called out to her, one of the piles of clothes shifted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_27@Mm—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_28@A girl sat up from the pile of clothes and rubbed her bleary eyes. I couldn't believe my eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_29@Her hair was long and soft... her eyes were lazy and innocent... and her youthful face complimented her plump figure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_3@I shook my pained hand. Looking at the strange home environment, I could not help feeling sad about my fate.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_30@...Isn't this super cute?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_31@You! Come with me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_32@I grabbed her wrist, pulled her up from the ground, and led her out of that mess as fast as I could.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_33@Hey—I'm still sleepy... Woah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_34@At the time, I thought this lazy girl could be a promising person with some hard work. But I obviously thought too simply…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_35@*Huff... Puff...* Ah! I can't run anymore...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_36@Tomoka, are you all right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_37@Hey, hey... I need to sit, or lie down...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_38@Tomoka looked at Akane and giggled. Infected by that lazy smile, Akane also smiled.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_39@In that case, I will sit with you. After some rest, we will move on together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_4@Why did it become so…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_40@After saying this, Akane sat down next to Tomoka. Yui was running past them when Tomoka waved to her down with a smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_41@Yui~! We're having a rest. Come sit with us, Yui!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_42@That's great!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_43@Then... One by one, the girls sat down together in a heap.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_44@The training ground was shrouded in a relaxing and lazy atmosphere. From time to time, the girls' cheerful laughter could be heard from the picnic ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_45@*Cough, cough!*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_46@Oh, my God! How could I…?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_47@Awoken by the sound of my cough, Akane stirred and opened her eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_48@I'm sorry, coach... Seeing Tomoka's sweet smile, I couldn't help but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_49@...Is laziness contagious? What magic is this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_5@The story started that morning, when I just went out for a walk. A middle-aged couple had jumped out of the grass and stopped me on my way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_50@Hey, hey! Coach, come here~! It is very comfortable on the grass over here~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_51@...Tomoka, do you know you are undermining our workout right now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_52@Hmm~? I know, but the grass is so comfortable...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_53@...You can't help it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_54@I sighed and sat down on the grass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_55@...It is really comfortable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_56@The lazy happiness that persuades people to relax is one of Tomoka's defining characteristics. In high-intensity and stressful athletic competitions, this may be a necessary skill.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_57@Take a five-minute break before training... Hello! Tomoka, you can't sleep right now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_6@Excuse me, are you the coach of the team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_7@Well, I am. What can I do for you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_8@To my surprise, they suddenly knelt down in front of me, groveling at my feet like crazy people.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_1_9@Coach! Please help us! We've really been backed into a corner!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_1@In one game, our team was being pummeled. We were pushed all the way back to our camp.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_10@I can't believe it... I didn't expect that Tomoka's laying around could be used to our advantage...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_11@At least we won. There's nothing to complain about.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_12@This time Tomoka is the MVP!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_13@Wow~! This is my first time getting MVP~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_14@In this case, let's go and celebrate together! Tomoka, do you like to go shopping?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_15@Hmm... Whatever is fine for me~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_16@As long as I have a comfortable place to sit down, I can lie there and relax. I'm so happy~ I can go anywhere~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_17@...Shopping can be pretty relaxing, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_18@Okay~ Let's go shopping together!「Tomoka's First MVP Celebration」—let's go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_19@I just want to go shopping…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_2@Damn it! That was so frustrating!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_20@In a shopping mall...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_21@Tomoka, how about this coat?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_22@It's very comfortable, and it's so fuzzy and soft~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_23@This sweater would look great on you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_24@So warm~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_25@...The topic was subtly led away from shopping…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_26@Ah, that recliner looks very comfortable~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_27@Tomoka staggered over to the furniture area.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_28@...Wow, this is really lazy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_29@Don't bully me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_3@Don't go out there, Rina. Let's gather our firepower before we try to break through... Wait. Where's Tomoka?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_30@I'm actually commenting on the furniture design.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_31@So it is…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_32@*Sigh...* Zzzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_33@Didn't I say you couldn't sleep?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_34@As a result, 「Tomoka's First MVP Celebration」 ended in failure, but everyone else had a good time, which made it worth it in the end.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_35@As we prepared to walk back to the dormitory, I couldn't wake Tomoka up. Feeling helpless, I had to carry her back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_36@Tomoka really lives in her own world…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_37@Haha... She seems to have found a place to rest comfortably.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_38@Tomoka leaned on me and slept soundly. I could only chuckle at her unsuspecting, smiling face as she slept.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_39@I simply can't do anything with her... but go back...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_4@Huh~? Where did everyone go?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_5@Tomoka?! What is she doing in the enemy camp?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_6@I don't know why... but the enemy is completely defenseless against Tomoka! Tomoka, move now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_7@Gee, really? Is that so～? Go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_8@Ya, ah, ah, ah, ah—!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_2_9@As a result, we pulled a victory out of defeat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_1@Tomoka! Why is your room like this again?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_10@Tomoka's room was actually bare of any leftover food or garbage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_11@I just didn't know why everything was on the ground—clothes, books, sundries, gaming consoles, pillows, quilts, and even Tomoka herself…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_12@So why are the pillows and blankets on the ground? Where's the bed?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_13@Tomoka looked around the room and circled a certain area.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_14@In this area... possibly…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_15@The "possible" range was quite large.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_16@You even forgot where the bed was!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_17@I managed to clear the bed, find the sofa and table... God knows how long it took me to find the furniture just from that room alone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_18@I worked on it for quite a while. When I turned to find Tomoka standing there in a daze, I could not help but get very angry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_19@Come on!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_2@Tomoka soon made the dormitory as messy as her room in her house. As far as I could see, everything was a mess. I couldn't see the floor of the room anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_20@I grabbed Tomoka, sat her in front of a pile of clothes and forced her to tidy them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_21@Gee~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_22@Fold the clothes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_23@I know~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_24@But after only three seconds, Tomoka fell into the pile of clothes, making it even messier.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_25@Get out—I'll do it myself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_26@I angrily threw Tomoka onto the newly-made bed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_27@Tomoka seemed happy about this and immediately relaxed. She picked up a fluffy doll and rolled around on the bed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_28@Coach~ Come on~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_29@Yes, yes, yes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_3@Well~ It's so comfortable...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_31@By the time I finished cleaning up, the afternoon was gone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_32@The setting sun was finally able to properly shine through the tall windows. My eyes glistened with tears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_33@Tomoka, it's time for dinner—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_34@When I turned to Tomoka, I found her asleep in bed. The clothes I had tidied on the bed were a mess, and the sheets were in chaos.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_37@I couldn't help feeling desperate. But looking at Tomoka sleeping so peacefully, I couldn't bear to criticize her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_38@Tomoka was sleeping unaware, unguarded. Her rolled up clothes revealed her waist, bare thighs and extraordinarily full breasts, which seduced me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_39@Tomoka had quite a plump figure, which would feel like cotton candy…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_4@Tomoka rolled on the ground, making it even more chaotic.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_40@(I'd like to touch...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_41@Imagining that wonderful touch, I fell into the biological battle of man.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_42@As I was struggling to keep my composure, Tomoka slept soundly and happily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_43@You shouldn't fall asleep so defenselessly…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_44@I sighed, for I did not want to interrupt her happy sleep. So I resisted my evil thoughts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_45@I shook Tomoka's shoulder to wake her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_46@Get up, Tomoka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_47@We... Have you eaten?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_48@Tomoka rubbed her eyes and got up. Every move she made was slow and lazy. I was speechless.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_49@Yeah, let's go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_5@I told Kana not to tidy your room for you, and you still won't clean it at all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_50@I patted her head and we left.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_51@Tomoka let me lead her without question. She couldn't help smiling as she watched me leading the way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_8@I lost my temper, but Tomoka was still lying lazily on the ground. It felt like she was a lost cause.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_3_9@...Aaaaah! I can't stand it! I'll just tidy it up!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_1@Coach~ Coach~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_11@Tomoka's eyes glittered at me, as if looking for praise.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_12@...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_13@I looked into the room again. It was still in a mess…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_14@Hmm? Wait a minute... It was still very messy, but I could see the floor now…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_15@Tomoka, did you clean the room?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_16@Yeah~! I worked really hard~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_17@Tomoka smiled contentedly, as if she had accomplished something important, even though the room was still messy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_18@Oh, yeah. It's great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_19@I patted Tomoka's head absent-mindedly as she looked up at me with doubting eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_2@As I passed the corridor, I heard a greeting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_20@Coach, what's wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_21@It's all right. Just still needs some work…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_22@I didn't want to complain, so I just left a passing word.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_23@!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_24@Tomoka suddenly threw her arms around my neck and pressed my head gently against her chest, stroking my hair like a mother comforting a child.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_25@Good, good~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_26@Tomoka's warmth threw me completely off guard. I coveted the heat of her body. I couldn't help telling her the emotions in my heart all at once.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_27@...Tomoka, am I a useless coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_28@No matter how hard I am on all of you, our team points could still be higher. Earlier today, our team was criticized in the meeting... and I feel so useless.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_29@Hmm~ I think you are a great coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_3@I turned around and saw the door of Tomoka's room slightly open. She poked her head out of the doorway and reached her arm out to me, giving away a mischievous look as she ushered me inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_30@I... think I'll always be happy, as long as I can lay back and relax~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_31@Mom and Dad think that it doesn't work. They tried so many different ways—and asked a lot of people—to make me work a little harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_32@But I made slow progress, so everyone eventually gave up. I didn't think I had to work that hard, so I just continued like that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_33@But... Coach, you were the only one who didn't give up on me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_34@...Tomoka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_35@Hearing this, I looked up at Tomoka. She was still as lazy as usual, but her eyes were pure and bright. She gave me a silly smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_36@Heehee~ Even if my performance is not very good, you are still very patient with me, making me feel as if I can try to work a little harder~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_37@So, yeah~! I think you are a good coach~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_38@That's right. The most important thing is not achievement at all—it's effort and progress. If I only cared about results, I wouldn't be seeing your smile right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_39@Thank you, Tomoka. I'm refreshed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_4@Hey, hey~ Coach~ Come and see this~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_40@After I said this, I raised my head, held up my chest, and looked at Tomoka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_41@Hey, hey~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_42@Tomoka showed me a lazy smile. Her happiness was infectious, and I couldn't help but smile back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_5@Hmm? What's going on...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_6@I was too weak from the coaching meeting to respond, but Tomoka just grabbed my arm and pulled me into the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_7@*Ding, ding*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_8@She opened her hands as if to show me something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_4_9@I looked in the room, but couldn't see anything special.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_1@Tomoka! You're skipping training! Tomoka!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_11@Looking down, Tomoka's plump body was clearly outlined in her extremely poor sleeping position, and her plump breasts were almost ready to pop out of her clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_12@Mmm. I swallowed my saliva and my mouth suddenly felt very dry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_13@(If I touch... )
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_14@I couldn't help reaching for her chest, with the softness and warmth showing through her thin clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_15@Tomoka didn't even wear pajamas... For a moment, I lost control and boldly kneaded her breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_16@Mm-hmm... Aaah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_17@Tomoka's slightly frowned, but her nipples hardened gradually with the rubbing of my finger tips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_18@I carefully played with Tomoka's nipples, and even though she was asleep, her body began to react from the touch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_19@This scene was too sexually exciting. I was possessed by sexual passion for a moment. I took off Tomoka's panties and gently rubbed against her body with my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_2@I stood outside Tomoka's room, banging hard on the door. Even after a while, there was no response.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_20@Ha, ah--—Hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_21@Tomoka took a sudden breath and began to moan softly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_22@Nghhh—Ahh... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_23@Tomoka's face was reddish. Vaginal fluid flowed out of her pussy, wetting and warming the penis.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_24@Even while sleeping, the body was still very honest and responsive. It was very alluring.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_25@(I want to go in, I want to go in, I want to go in...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_26@Looking at her pink pussy and the juices flowing out of it, it was as if it was inviting me in.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_27@(Only the tip... should...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_28@My reason told me this was just a rationalization, but I couldn't stand it anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_29@I shoved the head of my cock into her tight opening. The narrow, wet and hot passageway lit a fiery hot, numbing sensation of pleasure inside me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_3@Tomoka, if you do not open the door, I'm going to have to break in! Aargh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_30@Mm, hmm, hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_31@Tomoka panted, stiffened her body, and suddenly tightened her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_32@(Hmmm... I can't help but...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_33@My penetration woke Tomoka up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_34@Hmm, hmm... Yes...? Is this...? Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_35@Good morning, Tomoka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_36@I looked in her eyes and started pounding. Tomoka started moaning and panting. She twisted her waist in an attempt to change her position, but I didn't let her go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_37@Uh, ah, ah, ah... What... What...is this sensation…?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_38@See, we're making love. It's comfortable, isn't it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_39@Comfortable.. But... Ah, ah, ah... It's strange to make love just after waking up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_4@I kicked the door open easily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_40@Tomoka feebly pushed away, but finally only grasped my wrist. It felt like she was encouraging me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_41@Not surprisingly, Tomoka was lovely…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_42@I couldn't hold back anymore with Tomoka's lovely figure. I pounded into her with all my strength.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_43@Due to the repeated thrusts of my cock, the her pussy juices foamed at our junction and made us both sticky.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_44@Aaahhh... Aaaahhh... Aahhh... Your cock is so thick and hot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_45@Uh, ah, ah, ah... Your cock feels so good... Oh, yeah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_46@Tomoka was a bit inarticulate, as if she was so relaxed that even her mouth could not be shut. A little drool flowed from the corner of her mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_47@I can’t take any more... Aaahhh... Aaahh... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_48@Feeling that Tomoka was about to reach orgasm, I also accelerated the speed of my thrusts. Tomoka's groans suddenly became louder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_49@Uh, uh, uh, ah, ah, ah—I'm coming, coming, coming~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_5@Oof…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_51@I violently ejaculated into the depths of her pussy. Tomoka tightened her whole body and reached orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_52@Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm~ Yes...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_53@Suddenly, I pulled my cock out of her pink pussy as it was still contracting. It looked as if the heat of my hard thrusts was still affecting her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_54@Tomoka's face was reddish. She gasped for breath. Her eyes were glazed over. She could feel the semen flowing out of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_55@Woah... Is this... a dream...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_56@No, Tomoka, this was us… Making love… Tomoka, you are so sexy…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_57@I wanted to tell her more, but Tomoka slowly closed her eyes again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_59@...She fell asleep again?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_6@A loud noise filled the room, which turned out to be Tomoka's snoring as she slept a log on the floor. She was frozen in a pile of debris, covered in disheveled bedding with her arms and legs outstretched.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h1_7@Tomoka! Get up, Tomoka!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_10@Tomoka flushed and trembled all over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_11@Longer, longer. Your willpower and endurance are terrible. Keep going.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_12@Hmm... Oof~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_13@Looking Tomoka up and down, I found her posture to actually be very sexy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_14@Her hands and feet were held on the ground as if they were imprisoned, and her breasts were as plump and drooping as if they were ripe fruit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_15@Only her buttocks were raised high towards me. The shape of her bulging pussy between her hips was visible in her tight pajamas.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_16@I couldn't help holding out my hand to touch Tomoka's plump buttocks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_17@Eeek!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_18@It's endurance training. Keep going.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_19@I pretended to be serious, but I was already sexually excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_20@Hmm... All right…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_21@Tomoka frowned and endured with a pitiful expression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_22@Tomoka calmed down and I started something new. I grabbed her ass cheeks, and stroked and patted them until Tomoka made a moaning sound.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_23@(It feels like... That's great...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_24@The soft, elastic touch of her plump buttocks was intoxicating. I couldn't help but increase the strength in my fingers as I kneaded her ass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_25@Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm... No, you can't... pinch my ass…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_26@Tomoka groaned. The middle seam of her thin pajamas was slightly wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_27@Tomoka, you really lack endurance. This isn't acceptable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_28@I pretended to be serious. I suddenly took off Tomoka's bottoms. My long, stiff cock rubbed against her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_29@Mm, hmm...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_30@Tomoka gave a hazy exclamation. She tried to dodge me by slightly shaking her buttocks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_31@Is this a part of the training...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_32@That's right. Tomoka, you have to endure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_34@As soon as I said so, Tomoka stopped dodging. This made it easier for me to rub against her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_35@Mmm, hmm, hmm, hmm... Hmm, hmm... Hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_36@Tomoka groaned intolerably and trembled every time I stretched my waist and touched her juices with my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_37@More love fluid flowed out of Tomoka's pussy, and soon she could not help taking the initiative to sway her ass and beg for mercy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_38@I can't stand it... any more... It's too comfortable... I want…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_39@I have no choice but start the second-stage of training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_40@It's time for body-relaxation training. Tomoka, open your pussy as much as possible, in order to allow my penis to enter the deepest part of you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_41@After I said this, I straightened my back and violently shoved my cock into her pussy. Her tight pussy took my cock in completely with one thrust, and Tomoka couldn't help groaning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_42@Aha, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_43@It's too tight... Relax... Then I can reach deeper inside you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_44@No, no, no... It'll break me... Ah, ah, ah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_45@As I thrust forward, my scrotum slapped against Tomoka's pussy lips, and my cock was fully sheathed inside her, so that even the base of my shaft was hidden at our wet junction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_46@Isn't this better?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_47@I thrust slowly, and the gush of her pussy juices met my every movement. Tomoka was clearly excited when making love in this position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_48@Aaahhhhh... I’m going to break... I’m breaking... You're stirring up my insides...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_49@As Tomoka was wailing, she was also purposefully raising her buttocks to cater to my angle of penetration.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_50@That's it... I had discovered Tomoka's talent. She was usually lazy, but she was good at making love. She was actually pretty amazing at it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_51@Hmm, hmm, hmm... I like... making love... Your cock feels so good!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_52@Well... Your pussy is really sucking me in... Do you crave my sperm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_53@I want it... The white and hot... Just cum! Cum inside me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_54@Tomoka's allure made me peak, and a rush of semen shot from my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_55@Damn it—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_56@I stiffened and thrust violently into her. Tomoka's body also tensed up, and she raised her buttocks even more in an effort to reach orgasm in the stiffest, most accomodating posture.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_57@Uh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_58@As Tomoka reach orgasm, I felt her pussy greedily tightening, forcing my cock to ejaculate semen in waves, one after another. I filled her pussy with my semen, which overflowed and splashed out from our junction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_59@Tomoka was in a trance. She kept her position, with her hips and ass raised conveniently for our love-making, as if she had become a perfect sex doll.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_60@Ha ha... Am I making progress...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_h2_9@How long should I keep this posture…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_1@Since the team has won so many games in a row, the head of the team is holding a banquet with many celebrities invited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_10@Zzzzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_11@No way! She can still sleep even when being dragged like this?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_12@I patted Tomoka's cheek, but she still wouldn't wake up. I dared not use violence to force her up... So since nothing else was working, I had no choice but to give up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_13@Damn it... How can she sleep so peacefully...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_14@I looked at Tomoka's relaxed face grumpily. But after looking at her for a while, I found that Tomoka was really quite lovely, and her figure was also...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_15@A great idea suddenly comes to my mind. I hug Tomoka and whisper to her ear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_16@Hey, Tomoka, if you're not aware enough... someone might take advantage of you like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_18@Tomoka opens a small crack on one eye and soon closes it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_19@If it's Coach, I'm fine with that... Zzzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_2@Can't believe they're serving cocktails and there are even booths here... Rich people are just so lavish...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_20@... What does that even mean? Does it mean I can bully you however I want?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_21@Looking at her sleeping face that's completely off guard, I sigh and carry Tomoka on my back, since that's what a coach should do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_22@To protect my over-trusting member, I'd better get us back to the dorm as soon as possible.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_3@Ummm~ The cushion is so soft... It feels so good~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_4@Haha, of course there will be beauties for us in the booth──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_5@... Hold on. Why does that girl look so familiar?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_6@I can sleep without caring about anything here, Zzzzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_7@Of course you've got something to care about! And you're not allowed to sleep here! Did you hear me? Tomoka!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_1_9@Sleeping in rich people's booth... What on earth are you thinking?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_1@I opened the door of Tomoka's room angrily and shouted towards the bulging quilt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_10@That's why you need training! Relax. I'll show you how.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_11@After my back feels Tomoka's softness, I hook her arms tightly and bend forward.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_12@Woah~ Coach is so powerful. And... having our backs sticking together... feels so warm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_13@If you dare fall asleep, I'll double the amount of your training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_14@Ugh... Stingy Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_15@After I gently put Tomoka down, out of the blue, she tilts her head and rubs the back of my neck with it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_16@This kind of training... is to my liking~ Let's change all the training afterwards to this one, shall we?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_17@Ha... You like it just because you don't have to do anything, don't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_18@Yehehe... But there's a more important reason...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_19@Tomoka let go of my arms and falls onto the ground, lying there looking at me with a trusting smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_2@Tomoka! You're skipping training again! You've hit last place in the physical test for five consecutive sessions!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_20@Leaving my everything to Coach... feels so relieving.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_21@Really now. What can I do to you with those words and that face...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_22@──If you think I'll say something like that, you're just too naive! Come to the training field on time tomorrow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_23@What~~?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_3@Coach~? Don't get so angry... Let's sleep together~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_4@Tomoka was still in bed. Apparently, she did not take the work seriously. As a coach, if this can be tolerated, then nothing is intolerable!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_5@Get up!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_6@Well~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_7@I ripped the quilt off of Tomoka and made her do physical training on the spot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_8@Come here, press your back against mine, hook your arms with mine, lean forward, and raise me up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_2_9@Raise Coach up~? No way, no way. I can't do it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_1@To help Tomoka overcome her oversleeping and training-skipping issues, I'm giving her my last warning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_10@Oh, then how about "a set of pot and spatula"?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_11@It was also applied by Tomoka. Heard that she wanted Kana to beat the pot with the spatula to wake her up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_12@What on earth is she thinking...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_13@Even though it's a pretty strange try, Tomoka looks pretty determined this time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_14@However, the next week, Tomoka still arrives at the training field after everyone has finished the training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_15@Haauugh... Coach, sorry. I failed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_16@The way Tomoka rubs her eyes is just too innocent for me to scold her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_17@(There's only one way left then.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_19@At night, when Tomoka is going to bed, she finds her bed has already been occupied by someone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_2@If you dare be late again, I'll take away all your mattresses, cushions, and clothes, so that you don't have anywhere to fall asleep!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_20@Eh...? Coach, it's my bed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_21@I know. And I also know how hard you've been trying to make it to the training on time.\nI'll sleep with you tonight and wake you up tomorrow. I'll help you achieve your goal.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_22@I reach my hands out to invite Tomoka, who then squeezes herself into the empty space in the bed and smiles at me lazily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_23@Coach is really nice to me... Uhmmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_24@Haha, Tomoka is Tomoka. Just see how fast you're falling asleep.\n... Good night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_25@I wrap my arm around Tomoka tighter and fall asleep with her in my arms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_3@Ugh... If that happens, I'll have to sleep on the sofa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_4@Shouldn't you be thinking about how to get up on time?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_5@Hmmm... I'll try...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_7@Coach, please sign this file.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_8@About the recent expense? Let me see... Why did we buy ten alarm clocks?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P005_N_3_9@It was applied by Tomoka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_1@That day, I brought Akane to a local bar—a famous haunt for indie bands and dance troupes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_10@I clapped with the audience unreservedly as the show ended. Her amazing performance had even pleased an outsider like me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_11@Brilliant. She has the perfect moves! We must have her on the team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_12@In that case, let's go talk to her backstage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_13@I went with Akane backstage. We met with Rina, who immediately agreed to join the team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_14@But you'll have to live in the dormitory with us. Is that going to be a problem?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_15@Not a problem. Is that all?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_16@Yes. Just let me introduce myself again. I'm the coach, player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_17@I'm Rina, and I'm a dancer. I look forward to receiving your instructions, player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_18@But... Why did you apply to join the team, given you are such a great dancer?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_19@I want to expand my public presence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_2@This place is so crowded... even at this time of day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_20@The world of dancing is very competitive, and most dancers spend their whole career in oblivion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_21@But joining the team would mean exposure at tournaments on the global stage. As the team is well-known, its members are also the center of attention.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_22@I must take advantage of this and prove my worth to the world!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_23@I see. So are men your stepping stones to this fame?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_24@You bet. As a dancer, I know how to use my body, and those monkeys just want to climb all over me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_25@I grimaced at Rina's contempt for the men who went after her... But just the same, no team member is perfect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_26@Well... as long as you don't make any trouble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_27@Don't worry—I won't.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_28@Though we'd just welcomed a strong member to the team, I felt no sense of relief.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_29@(I hope we don't run into any trouble with her...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_3@In fact, it's the largest underground cultural venue in Star City, and only the best artists get to perform here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_4@And this new candidate for our team—Rina—will also perform here today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_5@Yes. And it should start soon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_6@The venue darkened. A beam of light directed everyone's attention to a dark-skinned, dainty girl standing under the spotlight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_7@Rina! Rina! Rina!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_8@(She seems quite popular...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_1_9@The young girl began to dance to the music. Her nimble limbs were full of energy, and everyone's attention was riveted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_1@One night...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_10@Rina seemed to be in a good mood. She stuck one hand casually into her pocket. Her tight shorts were bulging at the pockets, clearly full of something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_11@Unexpectedly, the middle-aged man Rina called "Daddy" ran out of the hotel in his bathrobe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_12@Stop, you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_13@Damn!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_14@Rina started running, and what followed was something right out of a Tom and Jerry scene.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_15@I walked out from the side door of the restaurant and grabbed Rina as she ran past me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_17@Follow me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_18@When Rina realized it was me, she quickly followed me into the restaurant without any complaints.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_19@After "Daddy" ran panting and gasping around the corner, I nonchalantly walked Rina out of the restaurant's main entrance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_2@I was walking down the street with my grocery bag when I heard a familiar voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_20@We then snuck into the alley on the opposite side of the building. Looking around, we confirmed that "Daddy" wasn't pursuing us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_21@Haha. You've got some tactics!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_22@Rina laughed without any sense of remorse and turned to leave, but I grabbed her arm to stop her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_23@Rina, did you steal that man's money?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_24@Rina stopped laughing and assumed her usual conceited air.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_25@So? Are you going to lecture me about it or something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_26@What's wrong with stealing, then? Gullible people are the ones blame—they're asking for it. Men are always drooling over me after watching a few of my moves. I didn't say I'd put out, and I didn't say I wouldn't steal.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_27@...And you aren't afraid of being kicked off the team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_29@An anxious look flitted across Rina's face. She suddenly stepped closer and pressed her body against mine, resting her small hand on my chest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_3@Daddy... Let's go now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_30@Hey, don't be so mean. It was just a joke...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_31@We're going back—now. We need to have a talk. As your coach, I won't allow you to behave like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_32@...Hmph!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_33@Seeing that I wasn't about to cave, Rina assumed her arrogant air and turned around in a huff.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_34@Alright, alright! Let's go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_4@...Rina?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_5@I looked around and spotted Rina walking with her arm wrapped around a middle-aged man. Their demeanor was very intimate with each other, and I watched as they entered a hotel together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_6@What...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_7@Spurred on by curiosity, I went into the fast-food restaurant across the street and observed the hotel through the window.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_8@No more than 10 minutes later, Rina exited the hotel alone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_2_9@Hm... Where should I go now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_1@...Ho!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_10@Huh...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_11@Stop acting like a scarecrow. Get over here! ...Yes, right there. Now stand still.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_12@Just... stand here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_13@Yes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_14@Rina loosened her body and started walking around me, smiling alluringly at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_15@Now pretend you are a pole.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_17@Before I could start complaining, Rina began to gyrate around me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_18@She didn't just move around, but danced in the most provocative ways, rubbing her body against mine seductively.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_19@I knew she was trying to seduce me, but as a man, I couldn't help but fall into her trap.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_2@Rina was practicing her dance alone in the rehearsal room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_20@♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_21@I stiffened up and looked at Rina, who was now teasing my nose with her hair. Her perfume penetrated my senses. Something began to stir inside me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_22@The music finally stopped, and I let out a sigh of relief.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_23@Rina stood in front of me and glanced at my crotch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_24@You are pathetic.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_25@That... It's just a man's bi... bi... biological reaction!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_26@Damn it. Rina despised men who easily fell for her. I felt crushed inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_27@I looked at Rina embarrassedly, thinking she would act indifferent... but she broke into a giggle.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_28@Heehee.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_29@Rina's giggle was indulgent. She seemed to really enjoy it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_3@Whether it was midnight or early morning, Rina kept up her training without slacking. This was the source of her pride.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_30@As for my sin of luring men in my trap... Let's call it even.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_32@Nothing. We'll call it a day. Thank you for training with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_33@Rina turned around in a snap. I stood there dumbfounded until she sauntered through the door and out of sight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_34@Did Rina just... thank me?!?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_4@I would usually ignore her and just walk by, but that day I felt like walking in. I opened the door, knowing she would notice me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_5@...! What? Oh, it's you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_6@Good work.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_7@You've come at the right time. Come over here and train with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_8@Me? I can't dance...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_3_9@I'm not expecting you to dance. All you have to do is stand over there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_1@One day, I went to see one of Rina's dance shows at her invitation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_10@Watching this focused and driven dancer, I smiled with approval.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_11@That is the true Rina, I thought.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_12@As her dance moved towards its climax, her moves became more provocative. She gyrated around the pole, seductively eyeing the men down below.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_14@Wow! Rina just gets more and more sexy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_15@You get me so hot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_16@Rina! I adore you!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_17@I grimaced as I saw Rina's fans fall under her seductive spell, one after another. She plays these men like small toys in her hand...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_19@After the show, Rina came over to my private box seat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_2@Rina! Rina! Rina! Rina!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_20@She was soaked in sweat, her cheeks still rosy from the excitement of the show.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_21@Rina, that was ama—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_22@Rina walked right up to me and leaned her face towards mine. Before I could finish my sentence, she started kissing me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_23@?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_24@Her nimble arms wrapped around my neck, her legs entangling mine, and her body rubbed sensuously against mine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_25@Her hot tongue stuck into my mouth and explored it deeply. I could feel the heat and passion burning inside her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_26@Just as I was about to grab her with my arms, she suddenly pulled herself away from me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_27@I think that'll do for now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_28@Seeing my dumbfounded look, Rina gave away a look of satisfaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_29@That is true seduction. Remember that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_3@Wow... her popularity never seems to dwindle. I'm glad Rina booked a private box for me—I definitely don't want to be buried in that crowd.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_30@...You mean your dancing is nothing in comparison to this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_31@That’s right.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_32@Rina snuggled up to me again and whispered in my ear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_33@Would you like to see something really... arousing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_4@Rina walked out confidently and stood under the glowing spotlight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_5@Hi, everyone!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_6@Rina! Rina!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_7@Rina deviated from her usual aloof self and waved at the crowd enthusiastically. I felt a bit sorry for the naive fans shouting about "how cute" she was.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_8@Thank you all for coming out here today for my show. Now please relax and enjoy my performance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_4_9@Music, on! Rina suddenly assumed a serious look and straightened her back, as if having changed to a different person.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_1@The door was locked, and the curtains in the room were drawn. Rina laid on her back in bed. She was all tied up, with knots covering her body. She glowed at me with a flushed face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_10@Hmph... Come on! You talk too much!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_11@Next... How many men have you lied to?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_12@... A dozen or so…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_13@Well, then I won't let you go until you've had 20 orgasms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_14@What? ...Don't go too far, you beast!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_15@I'll make you realize your wrongdoings.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_16@You're absolutely forbidden from cumming inside me! Remember that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_18@I pressed my half-erect penis against Rina's pussy. Feeling the head of my cock caress her, Rina immediately trembled all over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_19@Aaahh... Not there! That’s not good... Aahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_2@What's the matter? We made a deal. I'll won't interfere with you in the future, as long as a film is kept as evidence. It's what you agreed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_20@It was like masturbating Rina with my cock. We relaxed as our most sensitive areas fondled each other. Rina's stubborn expression gradually softened, and her love juices continued to gurgle out of her untouchable pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_21@Mmm... Mmm... Aaahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_22@Rina's body could not resist the pleasant sensation and gradually became hotter. Recognizing Rina's heat, I deliberatiey and violently shoved my cock into her pussy when she was on the brink of orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_23@Ummyaaaaahh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_24@Rina shrieked and shivered with convulsions, and her pussy tightened and convulsed around my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_25@Did you climax as soon as I entered you? You only care about your own orgasm. I haven't had mine yet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_26@Ah... Wait a minute. I just came... Uh, ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_27@I pounded my cock into her soaking pussy, and the erotic sound of her wetness met my every thrust. Rina seemed to be trying to stop me, but her tight pussy just made me even more excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_28@You, uh, ah... Ah, ha, ah... No, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_29@The sounds of her wetness with my thrusting got louder and louder. Rina couldn't fight back, and was forced to endure the ecstasy as she fell into the trance of a second orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_3@As for the content of the film, I got to decide... You agreed, didn't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_30@You were reluctant before, but now you pussy is closing tightly around my cock. I see now, Rina, that you're really just a bitch controlled by your own sexual passion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_31@No, it is... Hmm... It's not that…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_32@What are you saying? Speak up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_33@I shoved my cock deep into her pussy, then pulled it out again. After several of these torturous penetrations, Rina could only give out a weak cry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_34@Uh, ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah... Uh, huh. Woah... Ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_35@I pounded harder, making Rina's pussy juices splash all over her thighs and onto the bed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_36@Who agreed to be tied up for filming, just to climax over and over? Who?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_37@Uh, ah, ah, ah... Oh, yeah... It's me. Ah, ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_38@Rina's inarticulate reply was barely audible between the sound of her groans and my violent thrusts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_39@Aaaahhh... Cock... Huge cocks feel so good... Mmmmmmmmmh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_4@Bad guy...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_40@Damn it... Your pussy is sucking me in... I'll fill this naughty pussy with my cum!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_41@Oh, yeah... Cum... Give it to me... Ah, ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_42@Rina groaned passionately, completely abandoning her rules to become a slave to the pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_43@I violently thrust into her pussy with all my might. I felt her vaginal walls meet the shape of my cock, pulling me in and pushing Rina to orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_44@Aaaaaaaaahhhhh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_45@Rina let a long groan. I felt my cock being wrapped in her hot stream of fluid and couldn't help shooting my semen deep inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_46@Hmmm, mmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_47@With a slight quiver, Rina reached another climax in a trance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_48@Oh…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_49@I rested for a while. Looking at the mess of Rina's pussy, my still-inserted cock began to harden again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_5@I ignored Rina's stare—Her hands were tied up anyway, so she couldn't do anything. I spread her thighs wide open.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_50@I pushed my cock in again. Rina gasped, but her bounded body could not do anything but accept my penetration.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_51@...Twenty times. You can't resist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_6@As my cock moved closer to Rina's body, I picked up the lubricant and rubbed it over my shaft.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_7@The sticky lubricant dripped down from my cock and onto Rina's belly. Rina immediately shrieked.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_8@What are you doing?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h1_9@I haven't done anything yet. Well, you'll just have to take it. After all, this is a punishment. I'm not going to make it that easy for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_1@Late at night, in the darkest corner of the big city, "partners" gathered upon receipt of online notifications in order to watch the salacious live performance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_10@Rina murmured in ecstasy. I felt her heat and excitement as I rubbed my cock against her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_11@Oh, yeah... Ah—Cock makes me so comfortable…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_12@Watched by so many people... Surrounded by so many cocks... I'm already close to climax...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_13@You're too excited... You're soaking me with your juices. Do you really want everyone to see how wet you are?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_14@Yes... Please watch and enjoy Rina's sex show...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_15@Seeing Rina's full heat and wetness, it seemed pointless to deprive her of her desire. I slipped my cock into her hot pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_16@Ah, ah, ah... Come inside... Cock... your cock... That's great…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_17@Rina let out a groan and then instinctively moved her hips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_18@I'd only made love with her once before, but she'd already become the perfect plaything. Her pussy seemed to recognize its master and tightened passionately around my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_19@Rina, don't neglect the guests. Offer them a hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_2@In a hotel room, Rina sat naked on me, surrounded by several strange men.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_20@I slapped Rina's ass to urge her on. I could see that the other men were clearly excited further by Rina's lewd gestures.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_21@Heehee... All your cocks are so hard. Is it because of Rina?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_22@Rina looked longingly at the penises that were spilling their turbid juices onto her. She swiftly jacked off their cocks, moving her hands back and forth on their shafts as if she was trying to squeeze them dry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_23@All right, let's all come together... Ha, ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_24@When I saw Rina indulging in handling and playing with all those penises, I thrust ferociously into her and made her scream.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_25@Aaaaaah—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_26@You should concentrate on this, too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_27@I held her ass down and pushed deep into her most sensitive spot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_28@Aaahhhhhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_29@Rina was so euphoric that all her senses were contorted. Her mouth was slightly open, and her pink tongue stuck out slightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_3@Some were excited, some were craven, but everyone looked at Rina with their hot eyes as she straddled me and rubbed her body against my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_30@I could feel her extreme excitement and sensitivity. Her hot pussy was tightening and contracting. Rina became more excited with my every thrust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_31@Oh, yeah... Ah... Uh, ah, ah, ah... It's so intense... I'm going to, oh— o, o, orgasm... I'm coming, I'm coming...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_32@Uh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_33@Extremely excited, Rina quickly reached orgasm with my unrelenting attacks, sitting in a trance and gasping for breath.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_34@Don't have orgasm without my permission. There are so many people here. They won't stop until you make them ejaculate. Come on, Rina.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_35@As I said this, I straightened my back, and Rina screamed and regained her sanity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_36@Aha, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm—Ah, ah, ah... It's so comfortable…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_37@I don't know if she heard me or not, but Rina was totally engrossed in the primal and pleasant sensation of our sex.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_38@As she devoured my cock with her pussy, she continued off the other mens' penises with her hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_39@Even when my penetration made her lose her mind, the men grabbed Rina's hands and forced her to continue masturbating them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_4@Heehee... Welcome to Rina's performance. Oh, don't be shy, come on in!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_40@Some of the men rubbed against Rina's chest, armpits... Her entire body soon became sticky.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_41@Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah... Rina... Rina's whole body has become a sex organ... That's great... That's great…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_42@Rina was speaking with a lisp, lost in her euphoria. But her pussy was still not satisfied, and it continued sucking in my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_43@Rina, do you like cock?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_44@Yes... yes... I like cock best... Give it to me again…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_45@Heh, heh... I remembered that Rina hates people who are easily seduced by desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_46@Now you're surrounded by penises and excited by all of this... Now there's no denying that you're a sow dominated by desire!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_47@My entire cock was tight in the depths of her pussy. Rina spasmed and straightened her waist periodically, forcing her pussy to tighten again and again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_48@Hmm, hmm, hmm... It's me, I'm the sow of desire!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_49@Rina's irrational scream also aroused my desire. I thrust my hips like a beast, completely forgetting everything around us. It was as if there were nothing left but Rina and me, surrounded only by her erotic groans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_5@Although penetration isn't allowed... it's okay help with masturbation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_50@Uh, ah, ah, ah... Coach... Please give me more training... Teach me with your cock...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_51@Take my cum into your lustful womb, you sow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_52@Yes... Cum inside me! Release all your semen into me—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_53@My cock pounded violently into her, forcing her juices to squirt and gush. We became a ludicrous symphony, with Rina's irrational groans as the melody.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_54@Uh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_55@Ughh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_56@My semen shot deep into her pussy, and a trance-like flow of heat enveloped both Rina and me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_57@The other men were stimulated to their peak and ejaculated.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_58@There was a strong odor of semen, along with the sound of grunts and gasps—obvious signs of intense sex and obscenity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_59@Haa... Haa.... Haa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_6@Rina grabbed a stranger's penis in one hand and rubbed it greedily stroked it, relishing the touch of a cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_60@Rina was in a trance, slowly catching her breath. Her eyes was glazed over as she looked blankly at the oozing cock that was still in her hand. She gave a weak smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_61@Cocks... are the best…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_7@Haha... Jump, jump. It's so exciting!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_8@Her hungry eyes fed on the view of all the erect penises surrounding her. The mens' hot desire was directed completely at Rina.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_h2_9@Oh, yeah... So many cocks... I'm surrounded by the smell of hot cum…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_1@After getting back to the dorm, I take Rina into my office and hand her a stack of photos.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_10@What?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_11@I won't judge other things you've done, but you do know that stealing others' money is a crime, don't you? Instead of doing something that damages both sides, true justice should be donating the money you earn by working to foundations that can help abused children.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_12@I didn't know that Coach is such a hypocrite. You were also trying to make yourself look decent when you refused me, weren't you? But I bet you actually wanted me hard...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_13@Rina walks towards me and sits on my lap on purpose.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_14@Aah, maybe I did, since Rina is indeed charming.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_15@However, I won't touch you except when you really want me to.\nOr I'll be no different to those people who bullied you, won't I?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_16@While Rina is still in surprise, I put my hand on her head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_17@Try to do something nice. I know you as a good member of our team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_19@Rina stalks out of the office and stops.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_2@──This is...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_20@I'll donate the money. That's it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_3@The sponsor has conducted background investigations on every member.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_4@You were bullied by a boy when you were little, weren't you?\nAnd after you grew up, you used your beauty to take revenge on that guy who didn't recognize you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_5@I didn't care about it so much until what you had done made me realize that was the reason.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_6@That revenge made you look down on men who were easy to get lured.\nAnd from that on, you have "punished" those men with your body so many times... just like a moment ago... Am I right? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_7@Rina clenches her fist holding the photos. But soon, she raises her head contemptuously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_8@Since you've got such detailed information, I don't need to explain who is to blame.\nSo? What do you want from me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_1_9@Donation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_1@Beneath the blazing sunlight, the number on the thermometer is already over thirty.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_10@Yawn... Couldn't sleep well because of the heat... I should as well go eat the popsicle I bought yesterday.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_11@I notice a silhouette as I yawn. \nJust when I want to say hi, that thing in her hand stopped me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_12@Hey, Rina. What you're eating is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_13@Popsicle. Go buy yourself one if you want it. This is mine!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_14@I bought it yesterday...\nDespite the urge to say so, I swallow the words back into my stomach after seeing what's in front of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_15@Because of the heat, Rina has pulled the collar of her top really low. The melted popsicle drips onto her wheatish skin, flowing down from it as Rina moves and leaving a thick sticky mark.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_16@Why are you standing there staring at me? Is your brain overheated?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_17@No-Nothing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_18@I turn around and walk into the kitchen right away to suppress the agitation in my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_19@(Even though Rina didn't see it herself, that scene was definitely a kind of show as sexy as pole dancing...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_2@It's soooooo hot! There should be some drinks in the fridge.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_3@N-No drink at all?! Not even a pudding...\nDarn! Why didn't Yui help with our food supply?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_4@Oooh! There's still a popsicle! Lucky me~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_5@Rina skips back to the living room with joy and tears the package of the popsicle.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_6@Umm, it's pudding flavor~ Whoever bought it has a pretty good taste~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_7@Rina puts the popsicle into her mouth after lying on the couch in satisfaction.\nHowever, the popsicle melts so fast that it drips onto Rina's chest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_8@Humphhhh── Darn! I've just finished half of it... I'll clean it later.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_2_9@On the other side of the dorm, someone comes out of the room with floppy hair.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_1@The audience for water gun competitions has skyrocketed after it got hotter. Due to the rising revenue and our great performance, the board of directors is rewarding our team with a three-day vacation to an inn.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_10@As for me, I pull out a stopwatch to do what a coach should do, as always.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_12@When Rina finally stops, the moon has already there right above us.\nIt is so quiet that only her panting can be heard in the court.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_13@I got back to get you some towels and water. Here. Drink some and slowly walk for another two loops. And──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_14@Pant, pant. I know! You nag like a mother.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_15@Rina takes away the water bottle from my hand but then trembles because of the wind at night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_16@... You'll get a cold if you don't wipe off the sweat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_17@Tsk. Damn...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_18@I pull Rina towards me to dry her with the towels. After confirming that there is no sweat remaining, I hold her hand and walk forward.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_19@Wha-What are you doing? I can walk by myself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_2@All of the members have a great time during the day.\nAt night, when I'm heading back to my room, I see Rina walking out of the inn. I follow her and call her name.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_20@I know. But look how romantic this scenery at night is. Don't you think it's pitiful to walk alone here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_21@... You're so lame.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_22@Even though Rina says so, she doesn't pull her hand away from mine. Instead, she lets me hold her hand and walk with her in the extremely silent night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_3@Rina.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_4@Oh? At such a late time, you're not sleeping but stalking a pretty girl instead. So this is who you are, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_5@You also know it's late, huh? Why are you out so late? Did you forget to do anything?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_6@You're asking so much! I just don't feel like sleeping yet.\nHow can I waste such a wide court out here without jogging for two or three loops?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_7@You're not giving yourself a rest even on a vacation? Rina is just so diligent on both dancing and the water gun team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_8@Humph, stop nagging if you already understood.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P006_N_3_9@Rina stretches for a while and started jogging.\nBeneath the moonlight, her slender legs that move swiftly as if dancing are soon coated with sparkling sweat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_1@One day, we started our recruiting session to introduce new blood to the team. The venue was soon packed with enthusiastic applicants, but the better half of an afternoon turned out to be no more than a fruitless hunt...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_10@A young girl walked in briskly, like a small bird hopping on a window sill. The dull and heavy air in the room was immediately lifted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_11@Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Kana. It's very nice to meet you all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_12@She gave everyone present a radiant smile. I was jolted from my drowsiness and began listening intently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_13@My hobby is doing house chores. I love cleaning up my home and making it a relaxing place for everyone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_14@I also love cooking. I may not be the best cook in town, but I've been trying to polish my skills. To see someone smile when they taste my food the greatest reward.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_15@What an angel...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_16@The reason I decided to apply is because... I saw you in a match on TV, and I thought it was really cool!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_17@But I wonder if you are able to find time to really nourish your bodies with all your intense training and games... let alone clean your quarters...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_18@...And since doing housework is my passion, I thought I could be of help, so I decided to apply...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_19@I promise I'll do the best I can, if I'm given a chance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_2@That concludes the interview. Thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_20@*Bang!*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_21@My chair crashed to the floor as I jumped up from it. Akane, Nadeshiko, and Kana all looked at me in confusion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_22@Ms. Kana, please marry me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_23@What??
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_24@Haha... I think he means to say that you've been selected.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_25@It'll be a blessing to have someone like Kana taking care of us. We can count on her from now on!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_26@Re... Really? I've passed?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_27@Yes! Passed! Needless to say, I now welcome you onto our team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_28@Thank you. I'm very honored!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_3@Thank you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_4@It's so hard to find someone cut out for the team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_5@Maintaining the team's popularity is part of our management philosophy, so a candidate must have both athletic competence and attractive personal traits.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_6@That makes it ever harder to find the girl we need.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_7@Coach, focus! The day's almost over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_8@Next candidate, please.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_1_9@Yes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_1@Sorry to have kept you waiting. Here's the chicken cutlets with sweet sauce that I've specially prepared.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_11@Yui is trying to say that Kana makes this place feel like home.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_12@Stop flattering me. It makes me blush...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_13@But I haven't been doing well in the games. I feel like I'm dragging the team down...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_14@Not at all!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_15@The team replied in unison, taking Kana by surprise and making her smile with relief.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_16@Thank you, everyone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_17@Kana looked on with pleasure as the rest of us gobbled up her food, but the sad cloud hanging over her head lingered on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_19@After the meal, Kana started doing the dishes in the kitchen as I collected the plates and set them on the counter next to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_2@Wow!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_20@The team treats you like a goddess now, Kana!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_21@Nah... Don't exaggerate...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_22@But I'm not physically strong enough and I let everyone down in the games... and yet you still accepted me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_23@Kana tried to show a smile, but it was in vain. She was clearly upset at something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_24@Well... I don't think they are just trying to be nice to you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_26@I think everyone is moved by what you have been doing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_27@You've dedicated yourself to the team, hoping the best for everyone. How could anyone not like you? I'm a big fan of you, myself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_29@Kana's eyes twinkled with relief. The dark cloud hanging over her head was all but evaporated.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_3@Kana is quite the master. Every dish looks absolutely delicious!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_30@Thank you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_31@It's I who should be thanking you—the whole team counts on you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_4@As long as you don't mind my poorly-prepared dish, do help yourselves!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_5@*Munch munch!* Delicious! I could chow down three bowls of rice with this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_7@Ever since Kana joined, we've had a banquet every day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_8@And she keeps all the common areas clean, which makes the whole team feel more comfortable. It's really great to have Kana around here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_2_9@And whenever we get home, Kana is there to greet us like a caring mother!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_1@Ahh... I'm burned out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_10@Still feeling low, I returned to my room and flung myself onto the couch. After a while, I heard a knock on the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_11@Who is it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_12@It's me—Kana.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_13@Coach, you seem really tired. I've made some fruit-and-flower tea to help you relax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_14@...Kana, come over here and read what this says for me. (I handed her my smartphone)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_15@Huh? What? Let me see...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_16@May your fatigue be swept away... like a fallen leaf in a gust of wind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_17@...So... like that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_18@Wow! Cuteness overload.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_19@Kana is such a therapist... But I still have piles of work to do for the team. Just thinking about it gives me a headache...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_2@After a long day of hard work, I dragged my feet back to the dormitory.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_21@Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything that might cheer you up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_22@Well... Since you're asking...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_23@There's something only you could do for me, Kana—but it takes great willpower and skill to accomplish... Are you up to the task?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_25@Good, Kana. I can see your determination!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_26@So... Could I rest my head in your lap?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_27@What? That's it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_28@Yes, please! (I put my hands together) That would be super effective!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_29@I know...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_3@Despite Akane's and Nadeshiko's help, there were still so many matters I had to attend to. The leagues, coordinating with other teams... these responsibilities alone were crushing me to a pulp.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_30@Kana sat down next to me. She folded her legs and arranged her skirt, looking at me timidly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_31@So... Here you go...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_32@Oh, yes!! Ahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_33@I gratefully laid down my head, but the moment my hair touched her soft thighs, Kana let out a shriek.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_35@What happened?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_36@Nothing... It's just that your hair is a bit prickly, so it took me by surprise. This is the first time I've done something like this, you know... I just didn't know what to expect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_37@I see... The world is a beautiful place...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_38@What are you saying?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_39@Nothing... I said nothing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_4@That day I had to grind through another batch of lengthy meetings... Those bastards. If I see them again, I'll beat the living daylight out of them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_40@The fragrance of Kana's body wafted through the air. This, combined with the soft touch of her thighs, soon calmed me down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_41@I closed my eyes to savor the moment. Kana didn't say a word. Everything was motionless except the silent passing of time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_42@After a while, Kana stroked my head with her tiny hands. She started murmuring to herself, thinking I was asleep...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_43@I hope you feel better soon...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_44@Kana...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_45@I spoke to her with my eyes still closed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_46@Yeah?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_47@Please marry me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_5@Welcome back, coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_6@Kana rushed all the way from the kitchen to the doorway just to welcome me, wearing a beaming smile on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_7@I could have embraced Kana and lifted her into the air as usual, but I was too exhausted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_8@Ah... Kana... Yes, I'm back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_3_9@?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_1@How... How did I end up looking like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_10@Kana! Does that sound like something a vampire would say? If you don't do it, it is you who will have to die!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_11@Okay... I get it. So the vampire can't help it? I'll give it a try...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_12@...Aren't we overplaying our roles a bit?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_13@Alright, and your target is—player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_14@What? Why the coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_15@Because... Hm... Because you are the cross between a vampire and a succubus, so you can only suck the blood of a man!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_16@And now for the setting...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_17@What happened?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_18@Ah! Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_19@Kana, hurry up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_2@Kana was in a vampire costume, awkwardly trying to cover her breasts. Someone must have forced her into that outfit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_20@Kagano pushed Kana forward, forcing her to slam into me and grab my shoulders for support.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_21@Uhm... I... I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_22@Kana stood motionless, staring at my neck while she mentally fought herself on what to do next.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_24@I turned around and looked at Kana. A few seconds of staring into each other's eyes soon melted her last vestige of aggression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_25@I can't do it!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_26@Mission failed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_27@Kagano... Seriously, what is going on?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_29@Later, I found Kana alone in another room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_3@Rina and Kagano were circling around her in a menacing manner, like a pair of delinquents looking for trouble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_30@Even though the room wasn't being used, it was still clean and orderly. This must have been Kana's doing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_31@She's always so considerate, already thinking ahead and preparing so that a new girl could move in anytime.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_32@She was sitting on the ground with her head sunk between her knees—a lonely figure in an empty room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_33@Countess Dracula.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_34@Hey! Stop teasing me, coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_35@I can't do it... All that vampire business... I might as well die.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_36@You won't.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_38@For you, I'm more than willing to sacrifice my own blood.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_39@Is that... really okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_4@Kana, your kindness is your biggest weakness. It makes you an easy prey for the predators.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_40@You have been helping everyone on the team. And I, for one, would be happy to return the favor. This is the way you are, and there's no need to force yourself to hurt others.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_41@I tapped Kana on the head. She looked up at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_42@Right, now cheer up! We can head back to the lounge together. I heard they were trying to organize a costume party. I have no idea how all of that came about...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_43@Pfff...! Hahaha...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_44@Seeing my resignation, Kana broke into a fit of laughter, looking all chirpy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_45@Alright. As for the food for the party—leave it all to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_46@You bet!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_5@Exactly. Kana, we are here to train your guts. You need to learn how to plunder and pillage! This will make the team stronger, too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_6@I... I do want what's best for the team... but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_7@Kana, listen up. You are now Countess Dracula.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_8@And as a vampire, you need to suck the blood of humans for sustenance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_4_9@What? But sucking blood... That's gross. I can't do it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_10@Although Kana felt strange, she did not resist. This simple look was very lovely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_11@I'd like to ask Kana to add something to the coffee. It'll definitely make it better.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_12@What... is it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_13@Add some of your love juices, all right, Kana?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_14@But... that would be... very dirty…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_15@Definitely not. Please—without it, I may just go insane and die.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_16@How come...? Then... What am I supposed to do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_17@Don't worry. Just leave it to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_18@I reached my hand under Kana's skirt, sliding past her delicate thighs and nuzzling her pussy over her panties as I stroked her tiny breasts with my other hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_19@Ah, coach, that's…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_20@How could I get your love juice without touching you here? See? It's coming out. Your panties are getting wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_21@Please don't speak out... Ah, ah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_22@I saw an opportunity and seized it. I quickly slid her panties to the side and inserted my fingers, basking in the immediate heat and humidity of her wet pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_23@Kana's skin was as tender as a baby's, and she felt so good that I wouldn't have been able to stop even if I wanted to. I had no choice but to rudely take control.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_24@No... Coach... If you touch me like this…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_25@Kana shivered all over, and more of her pussy juices gurgled out. She easily indulged in the touch of my fingers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_26@Ah, ah, ah... Yes, I'm coming... Uh, ah, ah, ah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_27@As Kana was about to reach orgasm, I stopped moving my fingers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_28@Huh...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_29@That should be enough love juice. If more was required, my fingers would have to go deeper, and that would be too much for you, Kana.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_30@I feigned seriousness. Kana's face was flushed, as she was completely unaware that I was teasing her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_31@How come...? No, it's all right! Please, give it to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_32@Hmm?  What is it you need?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_33@Use your... inside my pussy... to squeeze out more love juice! Otherwise, coach, you'll go mad and die!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_34@Thank you, Kana!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_35@I quickly undid my pants and shoved my already-hard and pained cock into her tight opening.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_36@Ah, ah, ah—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_37@Kana  arched her back and tightened her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_38@Is that all right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_39@No, no problem. Please keep moving... Ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_40@I started moving, making Kana frown and groan, but her expression quickly changed. It seemed that she was actually quite pleased.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_41@Aaaahhhh... This is just so amazing... Aahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_42@I didn't think that Kana was so fond of juicing love liquid. She was so petite, and yet produced so much pussy juice for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_43@So good... It's so comfortable... Squeezing love juice is so nice...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_44@Kana didn't recognize my teasing at all, and she just lost herself in the ecstasy brought by my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_45@Kana can serve her coach... I feel very happy... Ah, ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_46@I'm not being polite anymore. I'm going to pound her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_47@The slapping sound of our bodies merging, along with the sound of Kana's groans, grew louder and louder in the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_48@Well, ah, ah... It's like... Oh, what is happening...? Ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_49@You're coming. There's going to be a lot of love juice coming out... Come on, Kana.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_50@Ah, ah, ah! I'm coming, I'm coming...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_51@Kana was like kid learning the word for the first time. She repeated the phrase over and over as both her body and mind were immersed in peaking pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_52@Ah, ha, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_54@The liquid released by Kana and me splashed everywhere. Some of our fluids landed the porcelain cup on the counter, tainting the coffee.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_55@Haaaa... Haaaa... Haaaaa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_56@Kana gasped when she saw drops of her love liquid land in the cup.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_57@Ah... Kana's delicious magic... Coach, please enjoy…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_6@I looked at Kana as she carefully made coffee for me. The view of her silhouette leaning over the kitchen counter gave off a matronly air of love. It was overwhelming.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_8@I hugged Kana from behind. She was startled and gave a lovely exclamation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h1_9@Coach... What's up...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_1@Coach, dinner will be prepared soon~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_10@Ah...! Don't do that... Everybody's still in the living room…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_11@No matter how the vampire begs for mercy, I won't stop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_12@I deliberately and violently twisted my waist so that my cock could rub completely against Kana's pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_13@Hmm, hmm... If you rub like that again…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_14@Kana felt the thin clothes on her body, and through her cotton panties, she could feel the strength and heat of my cock rubbing against her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_15@Because of the flow of her sticky juices, my cock easily felt glued to her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_16@And then... The depths are ready to cleanse.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_17@I pulled up her thin, soaked panties and rubbed my cock against the crack of her soft and tender buttocks. Finally, I penetrated her pussy from behind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_18@Uh, ah—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_19@My cock opened up her pussy as it plunged deeper. Kana could not help crying out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_2@Kana was ordinarily conservative, but today she wore a bright and sexy dress. Her alluring look made me unable to contain my excitement, and I grabbed her waist from behind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_20@If you shout so loudly, we will be discovered.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_21@Ah! Well, okay... Ooh…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_22@Kana quickly shut her mouth, but she couldn't help whimpering softly from the stimulation. The noise of our sex excited me more, and I could not help visciously rubbing her sweet spot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_23@Or you want to be discovered? You want people to see your pussy sucking my cock up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_24@Whoa, oh, oh, oh... Well…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_25@With tears in her eyes, Kana shook her head slightly, but she could not break away from her greedy indulgence in pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_26@Mm, hmm... Hmm... Hmm, hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_27@It made me even more excited to see her endure the fear of being discovered at any moment. She couldn't resist the ecstasy of my cock moving in and out of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_28@Kana—Have you finished yet? I'm starving~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_3@I've caught the vampire!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_30@*Clomp, clomp, clomp!* Yui was running toward us. Kana inhaled sharply.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_31@I stopped for a moment and hid my body just outside of Yui's sight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_32@Yui, Yui... Don't get too close. The the cooking is very hot…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_33@I looked down at Kana's messy pussy, with my cock still shoved between her thighs. The scene was too pornographic.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_34@Our delicious sexual passion was forced to stop. Kana's pussy tightened from the tension, and I simply couldnt wait any longer. Before Yui left, I started to shift may waist and thrust back into Kana.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_35@Ah... It's almost ready... Hmm...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_36@Kana tried to squelch her breath and speak, pretending nothing was out of the ordinary as she tried to cover up the sound of my pounding.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_37@When I finish... I'll bring the food out there... It'll just be a minute...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_38@I know—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_39@Watching Yui leave, Kana's body relaxed. I took this opportunity to shove my cock into her pussy as deep as it could go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_4@Ah! You are scaring me again... Hey...? Coach...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_40@Ya—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_41@My entire cock was wrapped in the tight and soft walls of her pussy, and I suddenly feel a warm heat come over it. Kana seemed to be having a little orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_42@No one's bothering us. Let's get down to the main course.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_43@I thrust like pile driver, again and again, and with loud clatter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_44@If anyone comes in again, they'll see. I was even more excited by this sense of immoral exposure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_45@Ah, ah—You're going to make me shout out... Oh, yeah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_46@Kana seemed to feel the same pleasure, and her groans became sweeter. Her indulgent look contrasted strongly with her angelic purity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_47@This solemn-looking vampire became a crazy succubus when she took off her clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_48@Uh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ha, ah, ah, ah—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_49@Well, I'm going to cum...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_5@Kana realized I was clinging to her, more than a bit restless.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_50@I couldn't resist Kana now. I pounded like a wild beast, and our pleasure piled up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_51@Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_52@A flash of heat washed through Kana's depths, as if filling her entire body. Kana trembled all over and took in all of my semen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_53@Oh, yeah... I'm cleansed... Thank you very much…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_6@I'm not a coach. I'm a priest. I'm here to cleanse evil vampires today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_7@Cleanse... vampires...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_8@With this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_h2_9@As I straightened my waist, my hard cock rose and pressed between Kana's thighs, playing viciously with Kana's pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_1@Ah... I'm exhausted…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_10@I've called everyone to help! Kana should come, too! Hurry up~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_11@Wa-Wait── She's already gone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_12@What do I do... The coffee...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_13@I notice Kana's hesitation and wave at her lazily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_14@It's okay to go. I can still do tiny chores like making myself a cup of coffee.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_15@Ugh... Then I'll be back soon. Coach, please take a good rest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_16@After Kana leaves, I climb up from the couch and enter the kitchen following the fragrance of coffee.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_17@Hm? Isn't it done already?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_18@I lift the cup to take a sip, but something stops me.\nNow that I notice, Kana has done a latte art of a big heart on the coffee.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_19@And I find a half-written note on another side of the cup. Kana's handwriting is saying "Cheer up."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_2@Coach, you look tired.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_20@... I feel motivated again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_3@Kana looked at me anxiously, and then clapped her hands as if she had just got an idea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_4@Oh, you should let me make coffee for you, coach! I'm sure I can cheer you up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_5@Kana ran to the kitchen with an angelic smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_6@I lie prone on the couch, feeling peaceful in my mind with the soft crinkling sounds of the dishes in the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_7@And some bumping footfalls suddenly approach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_8@Kana~ All the towels hanging on the balcony have fallen because of the wind!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_1_9@What?! How...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_1@Our team has fought a perfect game today── We beat the team without anyone getting eliminated.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_10@Well... There's suddenly a meeting to attend, so I'll have to go. Don't care about me. You guys have fun and enjoy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_13@After the meeting, when I get back, the moon is already hanging high above the quiet dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_14@Damn. I guess everyone has finished the meal. How could I miss Kana's homemade dish~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_15@Coach? Is that you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_16@Out of my expectation, Kana comes out from the kitchen and gives me a gentle smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_17@I kept some food for Coach and prepared a dessert... which is only for Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_18@Kana~ You're my angel!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_19@Hehe, because it must be tough being a coach. I'll cheer everyone up in my own way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_2@Your hard work has paid you back! Let's have a day off tomorrow so that you can rest well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_20@Come and enjoy~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_3@Phew... Now I can sleep well...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_4@How about going shopping together?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_5@Before that, we should have a party tonight!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_6@Alright! I'll make the most delicious meal to soothe you guys!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_7@When the happy atmosphere was around the whole team, my cellphone starts to ring.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_8@Hello? It's me... Ah?!... Okay, I got it. I'll be there in a minute.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_2_9@After hanging up, I feel so sad that a storm almost forms above my head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_1@Boiled chicken breasts again... How long do we have to keep eating them?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_10@Wha-What did you just call me?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_11@When the two of them are still in the fierce argument, a soothing fragrance cleanses the intense atmosphere.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_12@Guys, I've made some sugar-free and starch-free desserts that might refresh your palate...\nCould you try out the taste for me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_13@They look like tapioca pearls. Can we really eat them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_14@Yes, since it's made of konjac and lotus root powder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_15@...! It tastes good! No, I think it's more than delicious!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_16@I agree... This kind of pearls... I'll admit they don't really have to go with milk tea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_17@Hehee~ You're not insisting on your old-fashioned "Food Policy"?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_18@You...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_19@Alright, alright. Even though everyone has their own preference for food, all of us still consider Kana's food delicious, don't we? So, the conclusion of our discussion is that, Kana's homemade food equals delicacies.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_2@Maybe still a long while... since we're training to increase our muscle recently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_20@What? Is... is that so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_21@Yes! We'll leave the responsibility of saving our palates from chicken breasts to you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_22@Tell me if you need any ingredient. I'll get them for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_23@Okay! I'll do my best!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_3@Saki... misses desserts...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_4@I'm with Saki! How can any human live without pudding?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_5@Haha, I'm also missing the taste of pancake.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_6@Af if some weird switch has been opened, the girls started to state the cuisine they want to eat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_7@However, with some unknown reasons, their discussion gradually becomes a war about their values on food...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_8@How can something like tapioca pearls be mixed with anything other than milk tea?! It just destroys the wonderful flavor and texture!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P007_N_3_9@Ha, Miss Stubborn, do you know the theory that all delicacies are created with bold tries?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_1@*Ding, dong.*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_10@Hm... What a miserable place!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_11@I could not help being shocked seeing that woman.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_12@...Is that Kagano?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_13@Coach... Who is she?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_14@It's the young madam of West Garden Temple foundation. I was her tutor a few years ago…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_15@From what I remember, Kagano was a shy little girl. She was always following me around.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_16@I couldn't help smiling at the thought of her lovely younger self.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_17@I really missed her... Kagano, why are you here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_18@I didn't expect Kagano to stare at me as if she was inspecting garbage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_19@Put away that useless expression of yours. Starting now, I'm going to completely revamp this team! Especially you, player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_2@Someone was ringing the doorbell persistently. I shuffled down the hallway begrudgingly, only to see that I wasn't the only one who'd been woken up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_20@...Huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_21@I have completed a thorough evaluation. The team's performance is terrible. How could we win the championship going on like this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_22@The problem comes down to the coach—your insufficient ability prevents the players from meeting their potential! So I have to come here to help you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_23@But... What does this have to do with you, Kagano?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_24@It has everything to do with me, because I'm going to join your team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_25@...What?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_26@Now that everything's clear, we'll start the special training immediately. We have too much ground to cover to waste any time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_27@Wait just a minute...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_28@Kagano totally ignored me as she aggressively pounded the table to get everyone's attention.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_29@All right, we're starting special training!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_3@*Yawn*... Someone's here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_31@All day long, the whole team (but myself especially) was forced to pander to the all-round transformation demanded from the young madam until she was satisfied.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_32@I had not yet recovered from the shock of how much Kagano had changed. She had transformed from a sexy lolita into a wayward young madam that was happy to abuse us all day. I was physically and mentally exhausted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_33@Why did she become like this... And now she's joining my team... Why, Kagano?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_34@I dragged myself back to my room. I didn't expect to find Kagano waiting for me in the doorway of my room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_35@I have something to tell you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_36@...Let me go…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_37@Kagano, of course, wouldn't let go of me. She followed me into the room, and chattered incessantly in my ears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_38@As the coach of the team, you should think more about the team's future.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_39@You're not trying to recruit players at all! The team is much to small as it is. I have no choice but to join. Damn it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_4@Who is ringing the doorbell like that so early in the morning?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_40@She was repeating what she'd been telling me all day. I couldn't help but get testy and give an angry reply.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_41@I'm sorry, but this is not decent behavior coming from you. You, a young madam, don't have to be here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_43@Kagano suddenly calmed down, as if she didn't expect me to fight back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_44@Then, big tears trickled from the corner of her eye.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_45@Seeing my astonished expression, Kagano covered her face and turned her back to me, but her shoulders still kept heaving with her sobs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_46@Kagano, Kagano...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_47@At a loss, I tried to touch Kagano's shoulder, but she pushed me away ruthlessly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_48@Her teary eyes stared at me fiercely, but her normally-strong stance had turned into something weak and pitiful.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_49@Who do you think I'm here for?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_5@Open the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_50@...Huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_51@Come on, you fool! I don't expect you to understand!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_52@Listen, I only joined the team to ensure the reputation of West Garden Temple is upheld. I'm just doing what I have to! That's all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_53@Okay, I get it. Don't cry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_54@And who made me cry to begin with? I'm going back!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_55@Kagano stomped through the doorway, but looked back as she crossed the threshold.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_56@Don't forget what I said!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_57@*Bang!* I couldn't help but smile as she slammed the door behind her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_58@This guy is really not cute…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_6@Nadeshiko nodded and went to open the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_7@Get out of the way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_8@Ah… !
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_1_9@The people outside the door knocked Nadeshiko down as they stomped into the room. They looked around with their hands in their pockets, bloated with pride.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_10@What... What kind of person doesn't have any friends?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_11@If you want to join them, just go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_12@I... I don't know what to do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_13@Well, how about cooking something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_14@Is that all right...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_15@Yes, you do not need to cook anything fancy. Biscuits are okay. It's the thought that counts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_16@All right... I see.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_17@Kagano had made up her mind. I led her to the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_18@(But... can Kagano cook?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_19@(Well, forget it.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_2@As I walked out of the room, I heard laughter from the ballroom. It is often filled with girls' laughter, which is also one of the nice things about the dormitory.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_20@*Bang!*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_21@There was an explosion in the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_22@What's going on?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_23@I rushed to the kitchen, and other girls ran over to see what was going on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_24@Luckily, it was the microwave and not the oven that had exploded. Kagano probably got mixed up between the two.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_25@The exploded microwave oven did not lead to any other dangers, except for the full destruction of the ingredients. The flour bag on the table had blown up, so the whole kitchen was covered with white flour.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_26@Kagano was covered head to toe in flour. She looked like a rigid snowman, standing in the pure white kitchen as she stared at us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_27@Kagano! Are you all right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_28@Did you get hurt?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_30@The girls all ran into the kitchen. They surrounded Kagano and started cleaning her up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_31@I... I'm fine…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_32@Kagano regained her composure and then bowed her head in shame.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_33@I'm sorry this happened…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_34@That's all right, as long as you're all right. We can help you clean it up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_35@Yeah, we can help clean. Kagano, you do not have to work so hard!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_36@It's easy to bake. Let's do it together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_37@Kagano blinked and grinned at the friendly, smiling faces surrounding her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_38@Thank you…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_4@Looking up, I found Kagano standing in the corridor, looking off toward the people in the ballroom.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_41@As I walked out of the room, I heard laughter from the ballroom.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_42@When I got to the ballroom, I saw Kagano sitting with the other girls and talking happily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_43@Kagano, you really make an amazing madam, and for such a great foundation! You're terrific!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_44@It requires a lot of learning, so I really have to keep a tight schedule.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_45@What about other things? Is it the same as on TV?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_46@You're just thinking too much…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_47@(It turned out that Kagano also had a bright smile... It was much more fitting of a woman.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_48@As they cleaned up the kitchen together, Kagano was able to bond with the other girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_49@(This is great. You don't have to always be a crazy trainer.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_5@Are you envious?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_50@—All right. That's it. Now it's time for training!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_51@What...? No way out...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_52@Kagano stood up and held one of the girl's hands with a bright smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_53@Let's go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_6@What?! You... What are you doing here?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_7@I saw that you're frozen in the doorway. If you want to join us, just do it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_8@I'm not envious. I'm just... just…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_2_9@Kagano, you have never had a friend your same age, have you? Is that why you always worked so closely with your tutors as a child…?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_1@Almost 103 degrees Fahrenheit... There's really no way out…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_10@That's right... But the burden of being both a player and coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_11@I'm a member of West Garden Temple. It is not difficult for me to carry out business and planning, as well as respond to any sudden changes needed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_12@I can do better than you can with that 103-degree fever. Just leave it to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_13@...You're the only one I can rely on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_14@From a practical point of view, only Kagano can hold this position. Her identity and career helps her with this, and it makes her most suitable for the job.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_15@...No way! I'm still worried! So worried that I can't get a good night's sleep…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_16@I rolled around in bed with a terrible headache, either from the fever or from the stress.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_17@After a while, I laid paralyzed in bed. I was tired and miserable when I suddenly heard the door slam open.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_18@Kagano came in with her face shining.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_19@player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_2@I looked at the number on my thermometer and sank back into bed like mud.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_20@Kagano, what's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_21@I held my breath, waiting for her response. Kagano puffed up her chest with pride.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_22@Of course we won! You know I take these matters personally.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_23@—Really?! That's great!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_24@I jumped out of bed excitedly and immediately felt dizzy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_25@Well...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_26@Stop!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_27@Kagano came over to help me lie down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_28@Take a break. You still look terrible.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_3@Coach! Cheer up a bit!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_30@Once I calmed down, I became really drowsy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_31@In my trance, I remembered a little, introverted crying girl who once held the corner of my clothes, begging me to stay with her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_32@—Sir, don't go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_33@I used to work as a tutor and mentor with many children. I know that separation is an inevitable—but short—pain. I'd soon be forgotten in their fast-growing life.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_34@It was unexpected to meet a girl that not only remembers that time, but was able to grow up to be so independent.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_35@Kagano... You're really great…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_36@Kagano looked at the sleepy man and grabbed him gently at the corner of his clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_37@This person might not always come in handy at critical moments, and does not have any special characteristics... But after her countless childhood tutors, she recognizes who is sincere with her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_38@Sincerity was so precious to her that it would not easily be forgotten.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_39@...Of course, you know who I am. I'm a team coach that can help you with whatever you need.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_4@Why do you say that like I'm dying? ...It's all right, but it's just that I may not be able to compete today…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_40@Kagano covered player up with the quilt. Her eyes were welling up, and a confident and strong smile spread across her lips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_41@—Sir.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_5@Coach, you need to rest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_6@But today's game is for promotion. Without a coach…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_7@—I'll do it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_8@...Kagano?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_3_9@I'm going to be a temporary coach. I've taught the players many of the tactics anyways.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_1@One day, at the office...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_10@Kagano answered casually and looked up at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_11@Do you really care about me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_12@!!?!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_13@Kagano immediately blushed and turned hostile faster than leafing through a book.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_14@Who are you to ask that kind of question?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_15@No, no one cares about you! Fool!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_16@No, I mean... Kagano, you've come here and helped me immensely. I'm very happy, of course. Just I think about it. I only mean... it's so professional, there's nothing really personal about it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_17@Kagano looked at my face doubtfully, lowered her head sadly, and murmured in a low voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_18@You should become aware of... this kind of thing by yourself... Fool.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_19@Er... Well, by myself... I remembered that it was your poor sportsmanship that required my tutoring...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_2@—That's it. You see, with my advice, the team's exposure has increased a lot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_20@You did really well, and you learned ballet and yoga. You must be incredibly fit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_21@Hmm... That's because I didn't want to learn gymnastics, so I pretended to be physically weak.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_22@As Kagano said this, she looked gloomy. Then she whispered:
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_23@...As a result of my good performance, you had to leave very quickly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_24@Oh? That makes sense. If you don't need mentoring in sports, you shouldn't have to take lessons after school.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_25@I didn't mean that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_26@Kagano was so exasperated that she could no longer bear my thick-headedness. Finally, she spoke up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_27@...You were the only sincere person that I'd ever come into contact with.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_29@Other people only feign respect with me. They're hypocrites—if they praise me, it's only because they want bonuses, not because they're actually happy for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_3@Yeah, really... No kidding. Marketing our team had me pretty worried.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_30@...You're the only one who's sincere.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_31@Really? ...It must be very difficult for you to work with those people.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_32@But I haven't done much. I have a lovely team that performs well. Isn't it natural for me to be happy for them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_33@So, so... Ah! This kind of simple attitude is very precious to me! Ah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_34@Kagano was suddenly riled up and glared at me in a threatening manner... But I could not read anger in her eyes. The sincere emotion inside her was so intense that it almost broke out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_35@Do you know how lonely I am, surrounded by hypocrites that have lived their entire lives as fakes? You're the one who me made pick myself up and move on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_36@That's not a trivial matter... Don't treat me as a fool for remembering what you did for me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_37@I stared at Kagano blankly, unsure how to respond to her emotional outburst.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_38@Maybe I'm careless. This girl is always serious. It is her serious mood that led her to help me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_39@...I'm sorry... Don't cry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_4@I'm the young madam of West Garden Temple foundation. I can definitely do this thing. All you have to do is to follow my instructions.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_40@I wasn't crying!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_41@Kagano turned her back to me and swung her beautiful hair back, covering her tears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_42@I... I understand... Really, I do!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_43@I tried to plead with Kagano in an attempt to calm her arrogant mood.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_44@...If only you did understand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_45@Kagano took a deep breath and turned around. What she revealed was only her arrogant and willful attitude again, giving me orders with pride.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_46@Listen, you must take responsibility! You took my heart!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_47@Er... You want me to take responsibility, but I don't know what that means...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_48@You'll start with the team. Let me see what you plan to do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_49@Who just asked me to be obedient?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_50@Don't talk so much. Don't talk back!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_51@First thing is this plan. Just write it as I told you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_52@Yes, madam…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_53@The warm afternoon sun poured into the room. The coach bent down and filled in the form, not seeing Kagano watching him intently from behind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_54@Kagano  saw him sigh in despair and furrow his brow in thought, taking note of each change of his expression. A smile crept across her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_6@I turned to look at Kagano. Even from the side, she seemed to be in a good mood. It was rare for someone to be so happy when turning over statements.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_7@It was obvious that as the team got better, the person who really benefited from it was me. She was the one behind it all, but I was the one in the spotlight... Ah, did she feel happy for me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_4_8@Well, Kagano—may I ask you a question?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_1@player! Here's a report on the team's operations.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_10@Keep your voice down. If you scream like this, someone will come. How would you explain this to them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_11@You are to blame... Hmph!! Hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_12@I pressed my lips over Kagano's blabbering little mouth, and she immediately calmed down. The effect was surprisingly good.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_13@Well... Hmm... Hmm... Woah, hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_14@Kagano gradually relaxed. I could feel her soft, petite hands around my neck, and her soft tongue also clumsily entangling with mine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_15@Originally, I just wanted to play a prank on her, but feeling her response, I couldn't help but feel sexually excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_16@Kagano…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_17@Whoa, ha... ha... What are you doing…?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_18@Ah! There is something pressed against me…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_19@Hmm? What? Of course, that's it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_2@Kagano followed me into my room. Seeing the pile of documents in her hands, I already had a headache.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_20@I pulled down my pants with amazing smoothness, and my stiff, erect cock was able to press directly against Kagano's pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_21@Don't touch that thing to me! It's dirty!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_22@Kagano slapped me hard on the chest, but I was holding her waist so tightly that she couldn't escape.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_23@Aaahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_24@The head of my cock met the mouth of her pussy. Kagano trembled a little, and soon her cheeks turned crimson.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_25@Is it comfortable? Do you want me to move?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_26@Why would I want...? Hmph…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_27@Even as Kagano said this, she carefully rocked her waist as if exploring something, so that her body could cater to my cock. We rubbed against each other's sensitive spots.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_28@Aahhh... Haaa... Haaa...! Aaaahhhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_29@I didn't expect Kagano to be so promiscuous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_3@Give me a break... I've been listening to you all day…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_30@It's you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_31@It's almost time to go inside—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_32@Wait a minute. You... Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_33@My cock slipped into her slit and opened her narrow pussy inch by inch. Soon I had penetrated her deepest point, and our two bodies were fully entangled.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_34@It's really inside me... Your cock is so deep inside me... No... you...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_35@Kagano looked embarrassed and angry, but her slippery little pussy clung to my cock and revealed her true desires.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_36@If you're too noisy, someone will come over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_38@Well...! Her pussy shrank. Does Kagano like to be seen?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_39@Who...? Nobody likes to be seen...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_4@I took the documents weakly and threw them onto the table.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_40@I deliberately pulled the door open so it stood slightly ajar.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_41@What are you doing? No, uh, ah—huh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_42@As I pounded my cock into Kagano, she quickly covered her mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_43@Aahhh... Mmmm... Haaa... Aaaahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_44@Your expression is so indulgent. Not knowing if you might get seen... It must be very exciting for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_45@Kagano frowned at me, but there was no resentment in her groans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_46@I deliberately attacked her pussy with all my force, letting my scrotom slap against her body as I thrust again and again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_47@Oh, oh, oh, oh... No, I'll shout out... Uh, ah, ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_48@I pounded continuously like that for quite a while. Kagano's juices flowed freely from her pussy, as she had completely abandoned all reason.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_49@I... I can’t stop myself from making sounds anymore... It feels so good... Cock feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_5@You...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_50@Kagano  wrapped her hands and feet around me, completely forgetting any attempt to stay quiet as she indulged in our passionate love-making.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_51@Someone's seriously going to come over here if you continue like this. I had to lower my head and firmly kiss Kagano to hush her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_52@Oh, yes... Yes... Uh, huh... Hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_53@Kagano seemed to be unable to handle both my kissing and thrusting at the same time. Her pussy suddenly contracted violently, and my strong urge to ejaculate forced me to straighten my back and thrust even harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_54@Well! Uh, uh, uh!! Uh…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_55@Forgetting all our surroundings in that moment, I raised my head and pounded ferociously until I couldn't help but cum deep inside her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_56@Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_57@With her mouth free again, Kagano screamed at the top of her lungs and tensed up in climax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_58@Oh... Yes... YES…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_59@An incredible amount of my semen gurgled out from our junction. The scene of Kagano's sexy body was purely pornographic.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_6@Seeing Kagano angry again, I flung out my arms and picked her up like a child.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_60@I'll give you a bit of advice. If you play aggressive, then I'll fuck you hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_61@After Kagano heard my words, her eyes twinkled. I couldn't quite tell what she was thinking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_8@Kagano was shocked and panicked, but more embarrassed than disgusted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h1_9@What are you doing?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_1@One day on holiday, Kagano was intrigued by my promise of a surprise, and she hopped into a van with me to see what I had in store for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_10@Mm, hmm... Hmm, hmm, hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_11@Kagano trembled with excitement, and her nipples perked up quickly from my touch. I wondered what happened the young madam I knew who didn't mind if her pussy was seen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_12@This is my special gift for you... We can have sex here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_13@I whispered in Kagano's ear as I slowly pulled down her panties. She didn't resist, and I looked down and saw how wet her panties had already gotten.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_14@It's supposed to be wet and sticky now, isn't it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_15@Well…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_16@I want to touch it... with my cock. Will you take my pants off for me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_17@What a shameless man you are…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_18@Kagano cursed me in a soft voice, but reached out her trembling little hands and pulled down the zipper of my trousers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_19@Ah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_2@The van was designed with large, tinted windows. Kagano looked doubtful.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_20@Kagano and I both felt wet, hot and tense. I kneaded Kagano's breasts with one hand and gently rubbed her pussy with my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_21@Hmm... hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_22@Kagano trembled constantly. I noticed that her eyes were still looking out at the crowd, and her pussy contracted when she saw someone looking curiously at the van windows.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_23@Kagano, you are such a big pervert.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_24@What are you saying?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_25@Before Kagano could scold me, I suddenly straightened my back and shoved my cock into her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_26@Ah...! You'd penetrate me... in a place like this…?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_27@Kagano seemed to struggle, full of shame. I held her firmly down and pounded even harder into her, preventing her from even groaning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_28@Ah... You are too much... What are you getting excited about...?! Ah, ah, ah... Hmm...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_29@Kagano was soon subservient to the power of my cock, but I soon grew tired of arbitrarily manipulating her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_3@This van... Why is it so strange?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_30@Oh, yeah... By the way, there's a remote that can change the transparency of the glass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_31@I maintained my position of penetration as I pulled out a small remote from my pocket.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_32@People outside can see a little bit like this…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_33@Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Stop! No...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_34@Kagano panicked and struggled, but her pussy was so tight that it made my cock feel numb. I couldn't help but roar in a low voice and pound harder. Kagano became a total slave to my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_35@Oh, no, oh, oh... Stop... We'll be seen...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_36@There were tears of shame in Kagano's eyes. She raised her head and made direct eye contact with a young man outside the van.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_37@Eeek...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_38@Kagano give a gasp of astonishment, and her pussy contracted again at the same time. She didn't know what to do at all, but then the young man turned around and walked away as if he hadn't seen her at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_4@As she looked out the window at the crowd passing by, I held her from behind and fondled her chest impolitely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_40@Kagano realized that I had tricked her, and she turned her head to glare at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_41@It's a joke, but maybe it's still an option. Kagano, you like to be seen anyway.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_42@Who likes to be seen?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_43@Oh? But that's not what your pussy is saying.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_44@I used the classic method of stopping Kagano—stirring up her pussy with my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_45@Uh, ah... Ah... Oh, yeah... Don't move inside me like that... Ah, ah, ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_46@I deliberately pulled back Kagano's wrist so that her body could half-squat onto my stiff cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_47@Although her position was as crude as a hominid, it allowed me to penetrate her deeper with every thrust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_48@Oh, oh, oh, hmm... Uh, ah, ah, ah... Ah, ah, ah, ah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_49@Kagano groaned loudly. Her pussy juiced splashed against the tinted window, between the passers-by and us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_5@Ah...! What do you think you're doing?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_50@Passers-by continued walking past us unknowingly. But even so, her fear of being seen was still very strong.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_51@This is such a shameful position... Ha, ah, ah... Oh, yeah... Ah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_52@Do you like it? Or hate it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_53@Like... like... I like the feeling of being seen in a shameful position…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_54@Separated from the street by only the thin glass, Kagano and I made love as violently as wild beasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_55@Kagano catered to me in that shameful position. She completely abandoned the status of a young madam, leaving only her desire for sex.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_56@You'd better say: “Look at me! See my pussy being fucked like crazy by this cock. Ah, ah, ah, ah!"
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_57@Ahhhhhh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_58@Kagano reached orgasm with a scream, gushing her love liquid uncontrollably and making some squirt onto the windows.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_6@Take it easy. People outside can't see us. Let me show you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_60@The passer-by who happened to pass by the glass turned his head delusively but saw only his face on the glass of the van.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_61@As if he had heard a strange sound... Maybe he had thought too much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_62@The passer-by muttered and left.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_63@Separated by the glass, Kagano leaned against the glass almost naked and reluctantly watched passers-by leave.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_64@Ah... Just now his mouth was so close to my nipple…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_65@No way out. I'll help you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_66@An unremarkable van parked by the roadside was showing an unknown wonderful play…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_7@I lifted up Kagano's clothes. Her full, plump breasts bounced out and swayed, attracting my attention.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_8@Ah..!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_h2_9@Keep your voice down. They can still hear us. The van's mirror was specially processed so that no one outside could see the inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_1@What's wrong with all these texts? Make them into a chart!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_10@I might not be better than you on team operation, but I still have some more experience in getting along with other members than you do. Do you want to exchange opinions on it? I can teach you a little to thank you for teaching me today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_11@... Since you're almost done making your proposal, I'll listen to you for a while.\nIt's not like I want to listen to you or anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_13@First of all, all the members of our team are girls, so it's very important to give out nice facial expressions when interacting with them.\nThat means your long face is not gonna work. You should at least smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_14@Smile...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_15@That's right. Besides, you'd better compliment people more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_16@Sentences such as "Coach is the best" and "I like Coach the most" are great examples. You may start practicing it right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_17@... player, are you making fun of me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_18@No! It's just... seeing how serious you are getting, I can't help making a joke.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_19@So you were making fun of me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_2@And where's the winning rate of the team? Add them into the proposal!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_20@Bang! The thick stack of files is smashed on my face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_21@player is the worst! I'm not talking to you anymore!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_3@I can't help raising my hand seeing how Kagano gives me commands with a hand on her waist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_4@Hold on, Kagano. Didn't you notice something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_5@Hm? Notice what?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_6@The way you talk! You always talk bossily at work.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_7@It doesn't matter for me, but if you get used to it and accidentally talk like this to other members, you might cause yourself some trouble...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_8@Ugh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_1_9@Seeing that Kagano is faltering a little bit, I push away the keyboard and lean back against my chair.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_1@Kagano has been looking anxious recently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_10@Did he open it? Damn. I can't see it from here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_11@Uh... Kagano?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_12@Ahh! I'm just p-passing by! Don't mind me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_13@But you're existence is just too hard to ignore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_14@From Kagano's brutal eyes, I suddenly understand something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_15@Is it that you want to have some chocolate, too? You could have just spit it out! I've opened this box from the sponsor. There's another box of mine. You can have it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_16@... This kind of thing... should not be given to me before March 14th! Or it's just meaningless!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_17@Ah?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_18@I rack my brain trying to recall what day March 14th is and suddenly remember hearing it from the girls' conversation one time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_19@If the guy you like accepts your confession when you present him chocolate on February 14th, he will give you chocolate in return on March 14th! That is White Valentine's Day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_2@Kagano, is anything wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_20@Could it be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_21@I check the box of chocolate from the sponsor again and find a card with Kagano's handwriting on it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_22@Right. Today seems to be... February 14th.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_3@No! Nothing! Why are you asking?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_4@Because you've been walking around in front of my room for half an hour.\nYou can just tell me if there's anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_5@... I said there's nothing wrong!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_6@She just ran away? What a weirdo...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_7@Oh, right. I remember there's a box of chocolate from a sponsor. Where did I put it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_8@... Here it is! Wow, there are so many kinds of flavors. Which one should I start from?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_2_9@Just when my fingers are pointing at all the different chocolate, I suddenly feel a chill in my bones. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see a silhouette hiding by my door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_1@I've finished the meal. It was very delicious. Thanks for cooking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_10@The next day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_11@Hm? Is Kagano also here for Kana's cooking class?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_12@... I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_13@You can just go in. The classroom is still pretty empty.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_14@Akane gently reaches out her hand to Kagano but sees Kagano biting her lips in embarrassment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_15@I've never cooked anything in a kitchen, so I'll get in the way of other people's learning process... I should just go back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_16@It's okay.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_17@Feeling warmth on her wrist, Kagano raises her head in shock and sees Akane smiling at her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_18@Actually, I'm not good at cooking either, which makes me pretty nervous.\nI guess having someone to go to the class together might ease my nerves... Could you go with me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_19@Akane's hand on Kagano's wrist was as gentle as her smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_2@Everything Kana makes is so delicious! Do you consider opening a restaurant?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_20@... Sure. Let's go together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_3@It's not that good! You guys are just so nice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_4@It's true! I even want to learn cooking from Kana.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_5@That's a great idea! Kana, how about opening a cooking class? I bet a lot of people want to learn from you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_6@Eh? But...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_7@You don't want to?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P008_N_3_8@... No. If you don't mind coming, I'll do my best!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_1@Today's the day! Today's the day, Akane!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_10@I’m Itsuki. I’m a kunoichi, here for training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_11@Whoa! When did she coming inside...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_12@That’s just too cool! Itsuki, right? I hope we get along well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_14@Er... Hello?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_15@Please don’t think that we’re on close terms just because you've heard of ninjas before. This is our first meeting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_17@Hehe, Itsuki is really strict.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_18@Many people have strange fantasies about ninjas. Those who clamor about how it’s every man’s dream to become a ninja are particularly pathetic.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_2@What’s up, coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_20@Haha, that sounds right.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_21@Hey, can I ask you a question? I’m supposed to seek out the young master who rules this area. Do you know his whereabouts?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_22@If you're referring to our coach, he’s that guy next to you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_23@… Alas.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_24@She's actually sighing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_25@I must serve my master, no matter what type of person he is.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_26@I apologize for my disrespect from earlier, my lord.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_27@Well... Thank you... Either way, let’s all get along from now onwards.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_28@Please pardon my refusal. My sole purpose here is to achieve great results in the competition.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_29@Er...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_3@Today’s the day the legendary ninja arrives! A ninja will be joining our squad! I’m so excited!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_30@If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave for now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_31@Um... OK...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_32@What's with that person?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_33@Coach, try to be more understanding.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_34@According to our information, she grew up in a ninja family, but due to the decline of ninjas in the modern age, her training and beliefs are treated as a skill for a competition.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_35@I think she must feel helpless inside... I think she really wants to wholeheartedly serve a master who she is devoted to, just like a real ninja.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_36@Well... When you put it that way, I guess I do feel a little bad for her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_37@... But Akane, are you implying that I’m not worthy to be her master?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_38@Hehe... Please work harder to win her devotion!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_4@You’re the only one who is this excited...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_5@Akane, you don’t understand! That’s a NINJA! It’s every man’s dream to become a ninja!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_6@I’m so excited that I can finally see a ninja with my own eyes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_7@This type of dream is a incomprehensible to me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_8@Ding Dong—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_1_9@Coming! Welcome... Huh? There’s no one here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_1@I’m sorry, this is a battlefield.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_10@Sigh... Where could Itsuki be? Could she have gone out?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_11@Hmm? There seems to be something on the roof?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_12@It looks like a person? Could it be a Vampire? That’s impossible... Ahahahaha...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_13@Is something the matter?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_14@Whoaaaaa!! Eh? Oh, it's Itsuki...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_15@What are you doing on the roof at such a late hour?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_16@I’m on night watch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_17@Night watch? No matter what, it shouldn’t be a girl’s job to take the night watch...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_18@... Yes, it’s no longer necessary to do this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_19@Hey sorry, that's not what I meant…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_2@I've won!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_20@What do you mean?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_21@Well... Akane said that you were born in a ninja family... And... Er... Either way, you want to live as a ninja, but had no choice but to sell yourself to the squad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_22@... I guess that’s right.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_23@Itsuki... Are you unhappy here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_24@No. A ninja must seal her heart. There is only the mission. There’s no such thing as being happy or unhappy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_25@Um... Well then, do you want to change?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_27@Changing along with the times—isn’t that normal?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_28@Ninjas in the modern age must be even more true to themselves. Just do whatever you want.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_29@What I want to do? How can I possibly be so casual...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_3@Itsuki is so amazing! She's the MVP!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_30@It’s not about being casual. I just want you to be happy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_31@... You really are an unusual master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_32@I’m actually the coach, you know...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_33@You don’t need to treat me like your master. We're all friends and it's important that we get along happily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_34@But just remember to follow my instructions in the competition.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_35@I...I’ll give it a try...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_36@Ahahaha, Itsuki, you're such a serious girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_37@It’s late now so you better go to sleep. Good night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_38@Good night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_4@So amazing! As expected of a ninja! That blade is so cool!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_5@I’m just completing my mission.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_6@Oh, Itsuki… She's gone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_7@Are we dragging her down?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_2_8@Don’t think too much of it. You’ve all done well. She’s not too used to people yet. I’ll have a talk with her after we get back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_1@Whoa... I can’t seem to calm my heart even after training all morning. This has never happened before. What could it be...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_10@I... I think that Fuji senpai is really handsome...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_11@Hehe~ So Kana likes mature, and gentle boys?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_12@Yes! And Fuji senpai is so intelligent and reliable!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_13@I love Kazehaya from “Heart Story”!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_14@Haha~ Kazehaya is so similar to Yui!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_15@... What are you talking about?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_16@Itsuki! Are you just back from training? You must be tired. Come sit here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_17@Yeah... thanks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_18@We were just talking about the male characters we like in shoujo manga—we all have different preferences~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_19@Oh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_2@... Itsuki?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_20@Itsuki! I recommend that you read “Heart Story”! Kazehaya is so dreamy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_21@I don’t know anything about... love.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_22@That’s okay~ Shoujo manga is amazing. Your heart feels alive when you read it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_23@Is... Is that so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_24@That's right, Itsuki, I saw you reading “Pure Love” last time. I have this too. I can lend you the other volumes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_25@What?! Itsuki reads shoujo manga too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_26@!!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_27@I...I just... I read it because there was something I didn't understand! It’s not like I want to read shoujo manga!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_28@I’m going to go training!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_29@Hey, Itsuki!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_3@!!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_30@What? Didn’t you just come back from training...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_31@Umm... What problem was it? Why did you need to read a shoujo manga to understand it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_32@Hehe, could it be...about love?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_33@... No way~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_4@Itsuki??
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_5@Strange, she was here just then...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_7@Why did I escape...? Why does my heart beat so fast when I see master...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_8@... No more wild thoughts! Train, train, train!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_3_9@In the dormitory living room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_1@“... Even if you're the class president... You’re still a cute girl.”
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_10@Master... Please pardon my disrespect...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_11@No hard done. I frightened you. Are you reading a shoujo manga?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_12@!!!! This... About this... I...I can explain...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_13@There’s nothing you need to explain. Itsuki is a girl too. It’s normal for you to read shoujo manga.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_14@…!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_15@How can he say something like that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_17@A ninja must be agile, decisive and rational.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_18@I don’t need the identity of a girl... Is master looking down on me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_19@Why would I look down on you? Didn’t you win a lot of matches for us?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_2@How is it possible for him to say something so cool...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_20@There’s no question that you're our strong and trustworthy companion. But while you're strong, you're also a gorgeous girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_21@Well, I can't explain it very clearly, but I think that you don’t need to reject your identity as a woman because this is one of your strengths.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_22@Master... Thinks I'm strong? That I'm trustworthy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_23@Of course.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_24@You also think... I’m...I’m... beautiful? These are my strengths?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_26@No one has ever told me that before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_27@I came here because the elders thought I was pretty... The village abandoned me because of this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_28@I wanted to prove that I’m a real ninja—that my true value is not decided by my appearance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_29@Master... Do you know what’s most valuable to a ninja?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_3@It’s unbelievable. My heart beats so quickly when I read these lines. It feels just like when I see master...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_30@Er... I don't know...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_31@Her master’s trust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_32@But... I feel happier than that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_33@Itsuki looks right into my eyes. This is the first time I’ve seen her smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_34@Master trusts me and appreciates my other qualities that have nothing to do with being a ninja... I think I have a better understanding of what it means “to be a girl”.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_35@Itsuki...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_36@Thank you, master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_5@Could this be... The feeling of falling in love?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_6@Itsuki, so here you are! You’ll fall off one day if you keep sitting on the roof top!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_8@D—Don’t open the window so suddenly!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_4_9@Oh... I'm sorry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_12@This poison confuses people! It’s a fearsome poison, and maybe the others have been poisoned too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_13@I got it, I got it! Essence liquid right?> I don’t know what that is, but just take whatever you want.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_14@I release my hands and let Itsuki have her way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_15@Itsuki looks at me fiercely, some signs of struggle apparent in her eyes. Finally, as if she's made her mind, she reaches between my legs and strokes around blindly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_16@Wait...! You won’t get anything doing that. Why don’t I teach you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_18@Itsuki undresses herself and lies between my legs in accordance with my instructions. I also undo my pants, releasing my cock in front of Itsuki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_19@Lick this place first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_21@Itsuki pretends to be calm, but fails to hide the embarrassment on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_22@Especially when her tongue makes contact with my cock—her eyebrows curl up, as if she’s being humiliated.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_23@Smelly... Can this thing... Really release your essence fluid?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_24@Of course, now do a good job. This unwilling attitude won't cut it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_25@… I know.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_26@Itsuki sticks out her tongue, laying it along my shaft and starts licking my cock like a lollipop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_27@Mm... Is this... good?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_28@Ahh... Very good. Itsuki learns everything so quickly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_29@(It's getting hard... Gross... It’s so gross, but why is my body getting hotter...?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_30@My cock is soaked in Itsuki’s saliva, and thick transparent beads roll onto my balls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_31@Now that my whole cock is hard, I tell Itsuki to suck on it with her mouth. Her face betrays her unwillingness, but she follows my orders obediently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_32@Mmm... Mmm... Mmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_33@(Ah... What a thick stench... I can’t do this...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_34@Itsuki’s mouth is extremely warm, probably because she's drunk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_35@My cock is enveloped in a lot of saliva, and it drips out of her mouth even though she tries hard to keep it in while sucking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_36@Her mouth is simply amazing...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_37@Unable to hold back, I push her head forward while I tuck my hips in, thrusting my cock deep down her throat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_38@Mmm... Mmm... Mmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_39@Her naked breasts are stuck tightly against my legs. I can feel her soft breasts and small erect nipples.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_40@Do you like to be forced? I couldn’t tell at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_41@Itsuki’s throat keeps tightening against my cock like a pussy in response to my words.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_42@Well then... The essence liquid that you’ve been waiting for is about to come!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_43@I press firmly on her head and shoot my load inside her mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_44@Mmmmmm—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_45@I shoot all my thick semen into her small mouth, and some of it flows out from the corner of Itsuki’s mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_46@You have to swallow all of it to cure the poison.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_47@Hearing this, Itsuki holds back her urge to barf and sucks every drop of my cum back in without releasing my cock from her mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_49@After she swallows all my cum, I press her chin lift her head and open her mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_50@She does everything without resisting and her eyes are glazed over, but I don’t know if that’s because she was choking or if it was because of the pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_52@Itsuki pants while shaking, and clenches her legs together. I think I understand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_53@Good job, Itsuki. I think your poison should be cured now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_54@Y...Yes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_7@Oh no... My body feels hot and I'm feeling dizzy too... The food must have been poisoned.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h1_9@Not to worry... I remember an elder once said that this poison can be cured with the essence liquid of the opposite sex.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_1@On one night, an unexpected visitor came to my room as I prepared to sleep.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_10@No, I'm just... surprised. I didn’t think that Itsuki would agree to do this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_11@Because master, you admired my strengths as a woman...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_12@Itsuki unclothes herself in front of me until all she’s wearing is a traditional fundoshi.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_13@Her arms cover her breasts shyly while she looks at me with her bright eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_14@Master, please accept the female side of me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_16@Unable to tear my eyes from Itsuki’s beautiful body, my gaze wanders all over her body instead, as if I’m appreciating a piece of art from many angles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_18@Itsuki shakes as if she is uneasy or anticipating something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_19@Relax, it’ll be fine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_2@Itsuki, why are you here so late?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_20@I approach her from behind and rub my half-erect cock against her ass excitedly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_21@Oh... That place...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_22@Your ass is just the right size and soft and bouncy. It’s amazing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_23@Really? Do you like it... master?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_24@Hearing my praise, Itsuki lets my cock travel around her ass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_25@After her ass is covered in my sticky pre-cum, I slap her ass with my cock and proceed to rub her pussy with my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_27@She shakes when my cock makes contact with her pussy lips. Feeling how wet she is there, I start to slide it against her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_28@Hmm…… Yes……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_29@Are you feeling it? I got so wet from you rubbing your cock against my ass... And all the wet noises I'm making now are because of you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_30@As if she’s ashamed, Itsuki keeps her lips sealed and doesn't answer me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_31@If you don't answer me... Then I'm going to assume that you agree with me and I’m going to stick it inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_32@Wait...! At least let me take off my fundoshi...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_33@Too late!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_34@I thrust my hips, sending my cock that was poised at the lips of her pussy right into the depths of her hole, which swallows it tight immediately.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_35@Oh—What’s this... My pussy is being torn open... Aaaaahhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_36@Itsuki... Relax a little...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_37@Feeling the resistance of her walls, I let my cock advance gradually, inch by inch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_38@When it is all inside, I pause for a moment to let Itsuki, who is gasping loudly, rest and get used to the feeling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_39@I can feel master’s... Thing... Inside me... Both my body and my mind belong to you, master...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_4@For some reason, Itsuki looks shy and embarrassed, which gives her a womanly feel that is such a strong contrast to her usual cool self.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_40@The exciting part comes next. My cock will take you to heaven.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_41@I start pumping her pussy while saying dirty things to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_42@Itsuki’s frowns as if she’s being humiliated, but her pussy keeps getting wetter. I was right. She loves this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_43@By the time I start pumping into her with more force, Itsuki starts moaning out loud.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_44@Aaahh... Aaahhh... Aaahh... You’re so fierce... Aaahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_45@Having tasted the feeling of being a woman, Itsuki transforms—her curvaceous body moves sexily with my thrusting, fully displaying its charm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_46@This being her first experience of a man's charm, I bet she can never go back to being like before. I better be responsible and make her feel good then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_47@Itsuki, how is it? It’s great to be a woman, right? It’s so nice to be fucked by a cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_48@Yes... It’s amazing... It feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_49@Itsuki’s face is vacant. It looks like all she can think of right now is cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_5@She takes a deep breath before kneeling down in front of me respectfully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_50@You’re so addicted to my cock that you don't look like a kunoichi at all right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_51@No more... I’m not a kunoichi anymore... I'm your woman now, master... Aaaahh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_52@Let me be a woman... Use me however you want...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_53@Her pussy contracts lewdly as she moans louder and louder. Noticing that she is about to cum, I press down on her tightly and thrust hard in preparation for the final stretch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_54@Yes, once you know what it’s like to cum... You’ll be a woman!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_55@Something is coming out! Aaaaaahhhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_56@Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_57@Itsuki’s body curls up and clenches tight as she climaxes. As her pussy hugs my cock tightly, I shoot my load deep inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_58@I can feel her body shaking with each squirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_59@Even her pussy is so sensitive. Realizing this, the flames of lust light up within me again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_6@I’m here to service you, master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_61@Itsuki, there's a lot more you have to learn to serve me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_62@Yes, master... Please teach me everything...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_7@S...Service...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_8@Could she mean... That type of service...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_h2_9@Are you unwilling, master...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_1@After a hearty squad party, everyone returns to their rooms to rest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_10@Don't worry... I remember an elder in our village once said that this poison can be cured with well water that has been bathed beneath the moonlight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_11@... Maybe the poison the elder spoke of really exists, but I think you're just drunk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_12@I try to soothe Itsuki, but she grabs my sleeve roughly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_13@This poison bewitches people! It’s a fearsome poison, and maybe the others have been poisoned too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_14@Alright, okay! I got it. Take a rest here and I'll get the well something water here for you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_15@Of course there is nothing like well water in our dorm, so I pour a glass of water and get back to the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_16@Here's the water you asked for.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_17@Itsuki finishes the glass of water silently. After I put her into bed, she looks at me without saying anything for a while.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_18@Master...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_2@Everyone is in such high spirits this time and drank some alcohol. I hope they’ll be fine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_20@Sorry for troubling you. I won't get poisoned like this next time... Zzzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_21@Itsuki soon fells asleep. I can't help flicking my finger on her forehead softly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_22@The poison can be cured with anything I give you, huh? Really now. I won't let you drink ever again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_3@As I think that, I see Itsuki’s body fall against the wall.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_4@Itsuki! Are you all right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_5@I rush up to her and take her back to her room to rest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_7@From the feedback of touching her, I can feel that she’s burning up and her cheeks are all red. She must be really drunk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_8@Oh no... My body feels hot and I'm feeling dizzy too... The food at the party must have been poisoned.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_1_9@... Er?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_1@After accepting the advantages as a woman, she starts to show more expressions on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_11@On the day of our date, Itsuki arrives at the cafe on time, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_12@You don't have to be so nervous. Your joints look so stiff...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_13@Yes, I'm so sorry. I didn't do enough warm-up exercise today. I'll keep it in mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_14@No, it's not what I meant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_15@Your order is here── Woah!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_16@Itsuki turns her body around, takes away the plate in the waiter's hand, gets down on one knee, and swiftly lifts the plate up above her head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_17@Master, please enjoy it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_18@... Get up first, or I think someone will call the police.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_19@It takes me a long time to teach Itsuki the concept "dating is about pleasing each other instead of servicing only one side." But after learning it, she lowers her head in depression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_2@Itsuki?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_20@I... I don't know how to "please each other." I'm really sorry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_21@I don't know much about it either. But I guess this kind of thing is supposed to be learned together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_22@I reach out my hand to Itsuki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_23@Let's learn to do it together. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_24@... Sure, together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_3@Yes, Master. What's the order?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_4@... She really needs to change this over-prudish personality.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_5@A brilliant idea suddenly occurs to me. I pretend to look at the street inadvertently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_6@The weather is pretty good recently. How about let's go on a date this weekend?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_7@Clank! The kunai in Itsuki's hand drops onto the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_8@You── No, I mean, I'll do my best on Master's mission!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_2_9@... The conversation didn't seem to go the way I imagined. Is it really okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_1@In a cozy evening, someone suddenly screams in surprise.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_10@That night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_11@Itsuki being drunk is completely off guard! Stealing the Honest Potion from her was a piece of cake!\nHow should I use it~? Maybe I'll make player drink it? Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_12@Please wa-wait a minute.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_14@I, I want to make Coach happy, so please also give me some of the Honest Potion...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_15@Oh~ I didn't expect this little girl's intention on Coach. Now there's one more enemy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_16@Rina, it's wrong to steal things. Give me the potion!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_17@Damn... They're getting in the way on both sides of the hallway...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_18@Just when the girls are getting closer and closer to Rina, someone dashes into the crowd swiftly and takes away the potion in Rina's hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_19@Itsuki?! Damn. You're actually sober?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_2@Does "Honest Potion" really exist?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_20@Ugh, burp! Even though I'm severely poisoned, I'll risk my life to protect the Honest Potion and Master's safety from his diet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_21@The ninja puts away the potion into the hidden pocket on her chest and disappears in a flash, leaving a wind that breezes through everyone in the hallway.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_22@Did Itsuki just said... "poisoned"?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_23@Who knows. Maybe that's just some kind of signal.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_24@Tsk. Guess I'll have to wait for another chance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_3@Technically speaking, what it does is giving people continuous happiness, and therefore make them unable to refuse to answer any question. It's a great tool used in interrogation, so it's also called Honest Potion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_4@Isn't it pretty interesting? Both the part about continuous happiness and the part about becoming unable to refuse anything...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_5@Misako sis looks a little bit dangerous...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_6@I think this tool can work well but might also hurt people... Itsuki, please do keep it safe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_7@I will.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_8@Guys~ I made some liqueur chocolate. Please try it out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P009_N_3_9@Sure~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_1@I watch the competition in the waiting room from behind the protective screen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_10@But... after getting getting shocked that one time... my whole body has become weird... \nEspecially... when it comes to you... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_11@Akane rubs her body gently against mine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_12@Her wet clothes stick to her body, highlighting her curves. I can also see that Akane’s nipples have become erect under her clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_13@I try my best to ignore my tingling crotch and to maintain my dignity as her coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_14@The half-time break isn’t long enough...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_15@Akane has no intention to let me go. She hooks her soft around my neck like a nimble snake.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_16@Then we just need to finish sooner♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_17@Her peach-like lips kiss mine—the soft, tender, warmth cuts my wobbly connection with my rational thinking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_18@... Hehe♥♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_19@Sensing my response, Akane makes a naughty expression to show me that she's gotten her way before she continues to tease me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_2@I bet everyone else must think that I have ants in my pants. But the reason I can’t sit still isn't because Akane was forced off the stage by an electric strike, but because...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_20@My tongue curls around Akane’s soft tongue as my hands explore all over her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_21@She takes off her clothes herself to make it easier for me to enjoy her naked body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_23@Akane gasps in surprise as she sees a tent rise up in my pants.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_24@Don’t keep it inside your pants... I want it in me raw...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_25@You took your panties off too quickly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_26@There’s no such thing... I can't wait any longer already...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_27@Akane pants impatiently as she pulls my pants out of the way and sits down on my hard cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_28@Under her short skirt, her pussy grips directly onto my cock. Her soft pussy lips grab my cock as she starts moving her hips to rub herself against my shaft.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_29@Aaahhh... Aaahhhh... Aaahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_3@Aaah... Aaah... Aaaah... Aah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_30@Aaahh... Your cock is so hot and so hard... It feels so amazing no matter how many times you give it to me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_31@Horny and fully aroused, Akane props herself higher so that my solid cock is pushed against the entrance of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_32@This place... It wants your cock... Please give it to me, coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_33@In this position, all I need to do is thrust my hips to send my cock deep inside Akane's pussy... How can I resist this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_34@I thrust my hips to penetrate her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_35@Akane's pussy is wet and soft and I easily reach deep inside of her. \nIt seems that the special training has paid off and her body has become very sensitive. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_37@Akane raises her head and makes a lewd expression of pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_38@Be quiet...! Or else we’ll be discovered.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_39@I whisper a reminder to Akane, but she doesn’t seem to hear me. Instead, she wriggles her hips, lost in pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_4@Under the partition and away from people's gazes, Akane crumples to the ground next to my feet. She hugs my leg and moans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_40@Haaaa... Your thing is so amazing...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_41@Akane presses herself against me fully so that her body weight makes my thrusts reach deeper and harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_42@The pleasure from Akane’s tight pussy gripping onto my cock makes me forget that we’re right next to the competition stage. The only thing that registers in my mind is my desire to keep fucking her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_43@I grab her ass tightly. The springy feeling of her ass as her flesh pushes against my fingers is incredibly stimulating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_44@I thrust upwards as hard as I can, making Akane scream out loud.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_46@So you like it this rough? You're such a big pervert.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_47@After I tease her, the waiting room is filled with the sounds of our bodies slapping against each other. Lost in the pleasure, neither of us have the mood to talk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_48@The tight and soft walls of her pussy clench every time my cock enters her, and the feeling of my cock being massages is something I can never get sick of.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_49@Aaaaahhh... Aaahhhh... Yes... It’s so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_5@Does it still hurt, Akane? If you really aren't feeling well, I can find a subsitute for you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_50@The sound of her moaning mixes together with the noises of our bodies, but I no longer care about the volume.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_51@That’s because I’m sure everyone can hear the sounds of our furious body contact. I don’t care anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_53@A slut that can get in heat like this during a competition needs to be fucked hard. Her pussy needs to be teased until she cums her brains out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_54@*Slap* *Slap* *Slap*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_55@I embrace her tight as I can feel her cumming soon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_56@She squirms her body subconsciously, like she wants to escape; however, her pussy sucks my cock tight and won’t let me go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_57@Aaaaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_58@Unable to overcome her own urges, Akane climaxes from my cock and I also cum inside of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_6@Afraid of what other people will think if they see us, I'm suddenly pulled to the ground by Akane.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_60@Akane stares blankly into the air and seems number than when she was struck by the lightning in the match.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_61@I help Akane put her panties on, but my semen overflows from her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_62@Are you really able to compete?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_63@Y-Yes... I will do my best with Coach's fresh cum inside of me♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_64@Once Akane turns back to normal, I'm sure she'll be too shy to raise her head when she remembers this. \nI look foward to seeing the scene and return Akane back onto the field. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_7@By the time I realize what has happened, Akane’s soft body is pressed against me and she looks at me with round, longing eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_8@Coach... I want to fuck.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P01_h3_9@... But the match is still going on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_1@Sigh, there are no suitable people today either... I'm so tired; let’s go back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_10@Wait! Since you came out of the meeting room, could it be that you’re someone from the squad? Please! Let me take part in the selections! I can do anything!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_11@(Argh! This troublesome person has latched onto me...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_12@Er, yes, I’m the coach of the squad... You said you can do anything... But what can you do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_13@Humph... Since you're asking so sincerely!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_14@The first thing is this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_15@Whoa! So fast!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_16@And this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_17@Is this an avatar attack?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_18@Oh Darkness, devour!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_19@Whoa! What an amazing water gun attack! Speaking of it... Where did the water gun come from? But the attack is so accurate!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_2@…Hmm? I think I kicked something...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_20@How is it? Amazing, right? And I haven’t even unleashed the Darkness Beast sealed in my right eye!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_21@... I don’t want to admit it, but it really is powerful.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_22@(She’s so unpredictable that she can launch a surprise attack against difficult enemies...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_23@(Although she’s a little weird, but I must admit that she is a genius...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_24@Okay, you’re admitted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_25@Yay! Great Demon Lord, I've done it! Darkness magic will flourish from now on!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_26@Then sign the contract with me! I shall bestow ye with a mark of darkness!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_27@... Forget it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_28@Ohhh! Wait!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_3@Whoaaa! It’s a person!! Hey, how are you? Hold on!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_4@....Mm, mm...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_5@Oh! I’m too late for the selection!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_6@Not again... I'm a genius... The representative of the demon king and successor of darkness magic... I have such great power but will I miss out on this chance to shine on stage just because I overslept?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_7@Is this a hurdle from the Goddess of Fate? Curse those gods of light!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_8@... (It looks like a person who's here for the selection, but I don’t want to talk with her... I better leave quickly...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_1_9@I'm glad you're OK. I’m off now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_1@It’s finally the day of the competition...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_11@Sorry…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_12@It’s useless even if you apologize to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_13@I’m really sorry…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_14@Instead of saying sorry, just don't run away at the last minute, okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_15@Yes... I got it. I’ll tell you why I feel unwell every time I need to fight in an official match...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_17@This is... a curse!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_18@... I was wrong to listen to you so seriously...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_19@Aren’t you the successor of darkness magic? Why would you be under this curse?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_2@I endured the eighth-grader syndrome of Alice for so long, all for the sake of using her as a secret weapon to win this crucial match!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_20@... This...this is a curse of light!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_21@... Why would an idiot like this have such good physical fitness performance...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_22@Whether this is a curse or not, we must resolve this problem or else you’ll never be able to fight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_23@I know! How can there be any problems that a genius like me can’t resolve? I’ve decided to... Counterattack with darkness magic!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_24@... Huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_25@Leave it to me!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_26@Hey!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_28@“Rina joined us for the dinner banquet tonight. Everyone is getting along better now, so I’m sure our teamwork and results will be even better...”
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_29@Okay~ I should stop here! Hehe, my diary has basically become a log of our squad. Everyone is happier than I expected!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_3@We must win this match! Everyone, fight!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_30@Hmm? Something is outside...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_31@Arghhhhhhhh!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_32@What’s wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_33@There's a skeleton arm on my windowsill!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_34@Who played this prank? It’s gone overboard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_35@I grab the skeleton arm on the windowsill. *Crack* A skeleton falls mysteriously onto me from above.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_36@Arghhhhhhhh!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_37@Has Lord Lucifer appeared?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_39@No... Not...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_40@Are you responsible for this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_41@Hehehe... Yes! This is a three-dimensional array that I'm studying. I can even set up the core of the array in the dormitory. Amazing right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_42@As long as I gather arm of grace, skeleton, dark snake and frog jerky... I will be able to use this darkness array to summon the fallen demon Lucifer!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_43@... So what you’re saying is that you’ve placed these things all over the dormitory?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_44@That's right! If I’m successful, I’ll be able to overcome the curse!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_46@... Just don’t put these in the dormitory!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_6@Coach, my...my tummy hurts!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_7@Huh? You're kidding right? At a time like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_8@I can't go on!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_2_9@Hey!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_10@… Sure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_11@I could learn everything and was good at everything too! I was admired by my fellow students and praised by my teacher and all the adults around me—because I’m a genius!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_12@... Sure, sure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_13@But... When I represented my school in a speech competition, I suddenly became afraid when I was sitting under the stage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_14@With so many people watching me, I was afraid of making a mistake. What if I couldn’t take first place?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_15@As I thought about it, my stomach started hurting and I couldn’t compete.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_16@In the end... No one blamed me even though I didn't participate, and I even felt... relieved. I won’t lose if I use this cowardly method.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_17@I know that all I have to do is to do my best, but I couldn’t muster any courage again after running away the first time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_18@I think you’re really brave.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_19@Really?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_20@Yes, because you came to join the squad, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_21@You don’t have to win matches to be great. I think that those who can face up to their weaknesses are the best.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_22@Really...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_24@Really, really...!?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_26@*Cry* I did my best...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_27@Alice starts crying. I bet she’s always been hiding her fears under her confident exterior.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_28@I know you can conquer it if you keep trying.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_29@OK...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_4@Sigh... How many times have you backed off at the last minute now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_6@Again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_7@It's real this time! It’s true... You have to keep it a secret!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_8@Hmm…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_3_9@I’ve excelled at everything since I was little.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_1@To heal Alice’s fears, I made a plan and brought the squad to the seaside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_10@Next up we have a 3V3 friendly match. You won't win any points or get punished for this match, so enjoy yourself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_12@............
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_13@... I can’t go on!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_14@Already?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_15@There’s no helping it. I better go have a chat with her. Akane, you’re in charge here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_16@Okay.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_17@Okay, let’s split up into two teams!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_18@Hey pretty ladies, what are you doing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_19@... What?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_2@Whoa! It’s the sea!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_21@Sigh... It happened again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_22@Whenever I hear someone say “competition”, my hands grow cold, my heart beats faster, and my vision blurs... Maybe I’ll never escape from this curse...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_23@But it’s so rude to run away without saying anything... I better go back and apologize to everyone... Huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_24@Why is there a ruffian-like person with everyone? Are they... Having a match?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_25@Haha, didn't you say you were a professional squad? Why are you so weak?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_26@It’s against the rules to hit people with the butt of a gun!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_27@Is that so~ Didn’t you say it’s all right as long as we “knock others down with a gun”? Don't even think of repudiating. You agreed to go on a date with us as long as we win.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_28@Grr... Those ruffians... It seems like they play tricks when they’re in close combat... But they’re too fast and the others can’t hit them when they pull apart...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_29@What should I do? They need help... But, I, competitions... I can’t do it...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_3@We’re now holding a special dormitory event. First up is shooting training. You get a different number of points for hitting items of different sizes. The one who gets the most points gets a special prize!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_31@...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_32@I...I must be courageous...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_34@I...I must try my best!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_35@19-0. Is there even a point to keep going? There’s only three minutes left, and such a large point difference...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_36@Wait!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_37@Wreathed in dark flames from the abyss of hell, the maiden of darkness Alice is here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_38@... Who is that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_39@Let this genius be your opponent!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_4@Leave it to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_40@I’ll...I’ll also overcome myself! I’ll become even stronger!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_41@... What am I saying?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_43@Where did Alice go? I wonder if everyone else has finished their match. I might as well get everyone to help look for her... Eh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_44@Alice is so amazing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_45@You were so cool just then!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_46@Hehe... If it wasn't because my hands were cold, my heart was beating quickly, and my eyes were blurry, I would have dealt with them sooner!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_47@Oh, player, you’re here! You know what? I think I’ve overcome my fear!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_48@Really? That’s great! Then I can send you to fight in the next match!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_49@The n...next m...match...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_5@Take this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_50@I want to bark...! Urghhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_51@You haven’t gotten better at all!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_6@Whoa... As expected of Alice! She can even hit them with the marbles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_7@Hehe~ Because I’m a genius!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_8@... There’s nothing to complain about her ability.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_4_9@(But this just proves that there’s no problem with Alice's abilities. So it really is a psychological problem? We better take this step by step.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_13@I told you right? It’s not like it'll come true if I flick my finger and say something like: “you’re now a person who craves cock”.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_15@Alice’s body shakes and her cheeks become red.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_16@... Alice?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_17@I...I’m fine... I just... It’s not like I want cock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_18@Although she says that, Alice’s eyes stare right at my cock like a dog staring at a drumstick.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_19@Is that... so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_20@I lift her and fall onto the bed with her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_21@Yike! What are you doing...? When did my clothes disappear?! And there’s a c-c-cock...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_22@That’s right. In an instant, both of us are naked and Alice is sitting right above my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_23@Are you sure you don’t want my cock? It’ll make you feel really good.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_24@W-What...? You want to charm a witch of darkness with this move...? But if I move just a little bit...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_25@Alice mumbles to herself as if she’s chanting a spell, but she moves her ass so that her pussy touches my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_26@Aaahh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_27@Alice trembles upon making contact with my cock. She starts rubbing her pussy against my cock, almost as if she wants to clearly identify this feeling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_28@Aaaahhh...! Mmmm... Aaaahhhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_29@I thought you didn't want cock? But you look like you’re having a great time now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_30@Alice’s pussy is silky smooth like a young maiden, and she soon loses herself from the rubbing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_31@Mmm... Aaahhh... It’s not good at all... Aaaaaahhh!! It’s...It’s not good at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_32@Alice cries out stubbornly, but moves with greater gusto. The room is filled with the squishy squelching of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_33@Haa... Aahh... A bewitching magic...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_34@This is just the beginning. Next up is the fun part.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_35@My erect cock in front of her, she starts to make simpering noises like a puppy. However, she can’t stop me as I lift her body and lower her slowly so that her pussy lands on my cock—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_36@It’s in— My cock is about to conquer the body of a darkness witch—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_37@After my cock is swallowed by Alice’s pussy, she starts crying and moving her hips actively.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_38@(Mmm... Is this the sacred sword of darkness...? It’s so big and hot... If it moves inside me... I’ll go crazy...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_39@(But... But... I can’t stop!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_40@Aaaaaaahhh... Aaaahhhhh... Aaaahhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_41@The sounds made with each thrust represent lewd pleasure that player and her are enjoying.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_42@As the sounds get louder, her pussy also becomes wetter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_43@Ahhh... No... No... I'm going to lose to the cock... *Sob*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_44@Has she already gotten addicted to it? But this isn't all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_45@I hold her by the waist and lift her up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_46@Mmmmm...! This... This is the power of the sacred sword of darkness...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_47@Powerless and unable to move, all Alice can do is receive my attacks passively. She's supposed to be on top, but I'm fucking her like a masturbation cup.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_48@But unlike a masturbation cup, her pussy won't break no matter how hard I fuck her. Under my intense attacks, she is soon at the brink of cumming and starts sobbing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_49@Aaahh... I'm gong to be purified by his cock... I'm going to be enslaved by his cock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_50@Aren’t you already my slave? You can’t escape even if you weren’t hypnotized.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_51@Alice shakes her head stubbornly in reaction to my teasing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_52@But she arches her hips in accordance with my instruction and starts to rock up and down furiously according to my rhythm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_53@Seemingly unaware of her reaction, Alice is lost in the pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_54@I’m cumming! I’m cumming! I’m cumming...! I’m about to be conquered by his cock... Aaaahhhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_55@The built up pleasure reaching a climax, both Alice and I want each other so badly in this moment. My cock and her pussy mingle intensively until I also cum deep inside her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_56@Woooaaahhhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_57@Feeling her pussy getting filled with my hot cum, Alice screams and climaxes at the same time before collapsing powerlessly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_58@Haa... Ha... Ha...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_59@Looking at the thick semen drip out of her slowly, there is no longer any stubbornness in her expression. All that’s left is a vacant look of addiction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h1_60@I've been purified by the cock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_13@I push Alice onto the bed and put her in an embarrassing lewd position. She doesn't resist as she thinks this is the work of the tentacles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_14@There’s actually someone who can imagine that they’re attacked by tentacles, just like this. How amazing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_15@Haa... Not there!! This is so strange...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_16@Go away... I don’t want that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_17@Alice tries hard to hold back, but she seems to be making moaning sounds. I wonder what she thinks is being done to her?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_18@I can see her nipples standing under her clothes, and her panties are looking quite moist already.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_19@I feel myself getting horny imagining Alice being violated by tentacles. I can’t let myself be sidelined like this, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_20@I take my semi-hard cock out of my pants and place it against Alice’s pussy. Her body shakes as if this real sensation stirs up even more intense reactions.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_21@Yes... What’s this... It’s so hot and feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_22@I'm protecting your pussy from the tentacles, so you have to try hard to escape from the tentacles too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_23@I...I got it... I’m a darkness witch... I must tame this beast...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_24@But... My breasts—the small tentacles are wrapped around my nipples and moving like a tongue... I... Aaaahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_25@Alice’s body shakes gently as her pussy overflows with love juice that covers my cock and makes it sticky.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_26@I’m becoming an idiot... Aaahhhh... This is so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_27@You’re actually getting aroused by the violation of tentacles?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_28@*Sob* No, I’m not...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_29@Are you sure? Then let it continue.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_30@I watch as she becomes hornier. She moans like she’s being stimulated by a stick vibrator.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_31@Her pussy shivers, as if it craves more intense stimulation, and sticks tightly against my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_32@Mmmmm... I can’t take it any longer... If my nipples are teased like that..
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_33@Alice cries out from the stimulation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_34@*Sob* I don’t care anymore. Make me cum quickly... Aaaaaaahhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_35@My hard cock impales her fiercely, making her lift her head as she moans out loud.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_36@Her pussy that has been craving this for a long time clenches tight, stirring up my desire. I press the insides of her thigh and thrust in and out of her pussy forcefully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_37@Aaaahhh... Even my pussy has been violated... I’m done for...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_38@My cock pokes around everywhere inside her pussy, sending love juices everywhere.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_39@How's that? Have the tentacles disappeared? All you can feel is my cock now, right? Open your eyes and watch yourself get fucked by my cock!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_41@Alice can no longer hear my teasing. Her face is locked in an expression of pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_42@She was so stubborn to start off with, but now she’s quite honest with my cock... Let's cum then!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_43@Without giving her a chance to rest, I attack the most sensitive part of her insides. Alice takes a deep breath and her body clenches tight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_46@As Alice release her shrill moans, she climaxes with the hot surge that fills her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_48@Alice pants powerlessly and discovers that all the tentacles are gone. All that’s left is the cock inside her pussy and the cum that is overflowing from it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_h2_49@Aaahhh... Cock is the best...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_1@Coach! Listen to me! I’ve found a way to break the curse!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_10@Under Alice’s persistent badgering, I hypnotize her according to the method she taught me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_11@Ready... (Flicks finger) You are now hypnotized.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_12@Mm... I don’t feel anything...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_13@Coach, how about saying something to me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_14@Ha... Instead of spending your time doing this kind of thing, you'd better make yourself addicted to training.\nWith a training addiction, you should desire matches, where you can reap the fruits of your training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_15@Aaahh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_16@Alice trembles fiercely as her eyes are brimming with passion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_17@Training... Yes! I want to train myself so bad! How do I live without training!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_18@I am stupefied while seeing Alice running away yelling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_19@What the hell... Ha... Haah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_2@Alice... I understand how you're feeling, but can you not wake me up in the middle of the night?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_20@... I'm so sleepy. Anyway, I should just sleep.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_22@The next morning, when I wake up, I've already forgotten the incident last night. After having breakfast, I head to the training field.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_23@There's a match today, so I guess there shouldn't be anyone here. I'll only have to check it out before going to the court...\nWhat?! Alice??
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_24@Tr-Training... is wo-wonderful... Pant... Hahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_25@That girl is struggling on a treadmill despite her exhausted status, which reminds me of what happened last night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_26@Did the Hypnosis really work? Oh my! So from the last night, you've been...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_27@Yes! I love training! Only competitions can show my results──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_28@In the middle of her sentence, Alice finally collapses because she can't support her body anymore. Fortunately, I'm fast enough to catch her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_29@Competitions... Pant...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_3@But this is very urgent! You’re already up now, right? Listen up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_30@She just fainted...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_31@Even though you need enough training to deliver great performances, over-training might make you unable to attend the competition like now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_4@OK, OK, OK... What’s your method?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_5@Hypnosis...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_6@... Sure, thank you for your opinion. Now go away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_7@I mean it! Coach, you can hypnotize me so that I’ll no longer be afraid of matches. Wouldn’t that be great?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_8@But I'm no expert in hypnosis...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_1_9@Let’s give it a try!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_10@Shocked by Alice’s shrill scream, I turn my head to find Alice with her arms above her head and seemingly bound by something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_11@Coach, save me! Why are there tentacles?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_12@Could it be... She's has been hypnotized?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_13@A brilliant idea suddenly strikes my mind. I point at Alice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_14@Perfect! Tentacles, bring Alice to the court of the competition!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_15@Com-Competition?! Noooooooyaaaaaahh──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_16@Alice's legs drag her forward no matter how hard she struggles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_17@Don't mind the dizziness and stomachache. The tentacles will control your body in the competition.\nAnd you can overcome your trauma this time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_18@Ugh! Don't... there! Coach! These tentacles are tickling me! Ummhaaa~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_19@Don't imagine that kind of thing! Tentacles don't do that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_2@Huh? Alice... What is it this time?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_20@Coach knows nothing about tentacles! Tentacles, tentacles are... Yahahaha~ No~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_21@Hey! Don't move that way── Woah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_22@Bumped away by Alice, I raise my head fiercely and see her twitching nonstop like a fish out of water.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_23@... Even if I put you onto the court, you're not going to play well in the match, are you?\nPerhaps you'll get banned before entering the court for reasons like causing panic...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_24@Looking at Alice, who is still twitching crazily, I can't help facepalming.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_25@Anyway, I'll see who can join the match instead of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_3@Hmm? Coach's reaction seems a little strange... Oh well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_4@We’ll summon a demonic beast this time! Coach and I just need to chant: “Cerberus, I choose you!” inside our minds.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_5@And then we'll be able to summon a powerful demonic beast to break the curse!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_6@OK...! Come on!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_7@I’ve already given up complaining and resisting. Do whatever you want. Let’s do it and then pack up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_8@(How could this possibly work... What do you mean by “I choose you”... The only thing this type of chant can summon are tentacles, right?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_2_9@Yiahhhhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_1@Coach!! Listen to me! I have a good idea!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_10@Okay! The preparations are done. Now I just need to chant the spell... Part the heavens and sever the earth! Demon of unforetold power, I summon thee!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_11@...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_12@Do you feel anything!? Do you feel any tyrannical desires, endless strength or a feeling like you really want to vent?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_13@What on earth did you want to summon... I stop myself from questioning her and come up with an idea instead.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_14@Rarghhhhhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_15@I howl loudly and lift Alice off the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_16@Fighting! Competing!... Only a strong desire for victories can ease the agitation in my body!\nSatisfy me with competitions! Otherwise, I'll destroy the world! Huhahaha~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_17@It wo-worked? That way, my curse should be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_18@... Uggh, it's not. I still feel sick thinking about how I might fail in competitions...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_19@Alice puts her hand on mine and looks like she's about to throw up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_2@... Really? Aren’t you sick of saying that every time? What’s up this time?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_20@Witch, are you questioning my might? Along with the curse in you, you should succumb to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_21@According to how thou talk... thou art the leader of the demons!\nAah, please look at me! I'm willing to devote my life for thee!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_22@Alice clenches her teeth when she reaches out for the competition schedule on her table.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_23@However, as soon as she sees the word "competition," her face starts turning pale and her lips start trembling. I think she is about to faint.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_24@(Hey... Is she okay? I feel like something bad would happen if I continue. I should stop for now.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_25@I let out a breath and put Alice down softly while putting away the brutal look I have faked on purpose.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_26@Alice. He's gone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_27@What? But I haven't...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_28@That seemed to be just a weak demon. He was satisfied after feeling your determination to work harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_29@... So that's how it is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_3@Well, I was thinking... Since there’s no way to stop the curse... Why don’t we fight fire with fire!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_30@Alice murmurs. Then she falls into my arms as her legs turn to jelly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_31@Alice?! Hey, are you okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_32@So this is how it feels when my magic power gets drained...\nI've got a feeling that we're getting closer to success. Guess I'll be able to get rid of the curse next time. Phew...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_33@The exhausted Alice falls asleep in my arms. Her murmurs only make me feel confused and troubled.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_34@Do I still have to do this kind of thing again...? Give me a break...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_4@We’ll summon an even more powerful demon to possess you, Coach. Then you’ll have a strong enough aura to suppress my curse! So?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_5@... So what? She said something that strange and is even looking at me with sparkling eyes. What reaction is she expecting from me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_6@It looks like I have no choice...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_7@You’re right. So what should we do next?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_8@Oh! Coach, you're really motivated today! Let’s start immediately!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P010_N_3_9@Alice sets up a number of items used for black magic in my room at the speed of light and makes me stand in a peculiar array.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_1@Wake up! Wake up already! Get ready and line up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_11@Woooaaahhhh!! A-A-A-Akane, open the door for me! No... No! I should open it myself. I-I-I’ll do it myself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_12@He’s so nervous...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_13@I wonder what she’s like?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_14@Hi! Welcome to our squad! I’m player, the coach of the squad. I hope we get along well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_15@Hehehehe... There’s no need to be this nervous. I’m one of your members from today onwards, player. Please take good care of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_16@(Oh! It’s a kind beauty...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_17@Oh? Did everyone gather her to welcome me? Thank you all for coming over~ I'm Misako. Please take good care of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_18@(She feels like a mother...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_19@Oh... You’re being so polite. Please take care of us. Well, there are some documents to confirm, so please follow me to the office.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_2@Coach, Tomoka isn't responding. What should I do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_21@The coach’s office.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_22@Please sign here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_24@(Stuck here in a room with a mature beauty, my thoughts are out of control...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_25@... Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_26@Huh?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_27@I was asking you if this is it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_28@Misako leans closer until our bodies are almost against each other. A sweet fragrance makes its way into my nose, and I can see how large her breasts are from this angle...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_29@Er... Not yet! You need to sign this side too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_3@Leave her for now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_30@Oh my, I’m so... You’re so meticulous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_31@Misako lowers her head to write on the document. Because the document is so close to her breasts, my eyes keep staring at her giant breasts...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_32@(Whoa... Her breasts are basically against the clipboard... I’m so envious of that clipboard... I want those breasts to push against me too...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_33@Hehe... Do you want to touch them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_34@... Eh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_35@Misako seems to have turned into a different person and looks at me with her charming eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_36@I know that all boys miss their mother’s breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_37@... No, that’s not it! I wasn’t thinking of anything disrespectful!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_38@Hehe, it’s not good to lie... Look at how vigorous your little friend is.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_4@Ha! player, why are you so grump so early in the morning...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_40@I cover my legs subconsciously and realize that nothing had happened at all. But my action had completely betrayed me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_41@Misako laughs happily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_42@Hehehehe... Don’t hide it. I want to see it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_43@...?!!?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_44@I’m looking forward to finding out how much endurance you have, coach. Please Take. Good. Care. Of. Me, coach ♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_45@Misako blows gently into my ear and winks meaningfully at me before leaving slowly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_46@I stand there like a statue for a long time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_47@Misako seems to have joined the squad for some ulterior motives?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_5@Haha, it’s because an amazing person is coming to our squad today and coach is nervous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_6@Amazing person?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_7@I heard its the wife of some officer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_8@The wife of an officer? Why would she be joining our squad?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_1_9@I want to know too... Ah, my tummy is hurting from anxiety...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_1@Squad physical fitness training. Vaulting Box.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_11@If you have time, can you give me some private instruction? I want to do more practice...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_12@Oh, of course.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_13@Let’s start by stretching. It’ll be easier to do the other things if you’re more flexible.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_15@Sit over here. I’ll push for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_16@Thank you, coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_17@Ah… ! Ouch! Um...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_18@... Misako, are you all right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_19@Yes... I think so... You can move now, coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_2@Hiya!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_20@Don’t say things that’ll make people misunderstand! And I didn’t use any force at all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_21@Honestly... For real this time... (press)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_22@Ouch!... Wait, coach. Don’t do that...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_23@But that wasn’t much?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_25@Haa... I haven’t exercised so seriously in ages. I’m hammered!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_26@... (Although she didn't do anything other than stretches, I probably shouldn't say anything)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_27@Sorry coach, you spent so much time with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_28@Not a problem. As your coach, I should support you if you want to improve.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_29@Ah... After doing these exercises, I can feel that my stamina is a lot worse than before.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_3@Good job, Yui! Next.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_30@Recently, I’ve been worried that I'm getting older as the years pile up... I want to feel like a maiden again. That’s why I asked my husband to let me join the squad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_31@... Was it really too much?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_32@Not at all. You’ll improve as long as you work hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_33@I think that you’re just like a young maiden when you work hard like this, Misako.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_34@Thank you… Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_35@It was great to come here. I feel younger again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_37@Hehehehe... It’s a secret♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_38@... (I feel danger...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_4@Ah~ Ha!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_6@Watch out! You’ll get injured if you fall like that. It doesn’t matter if you fail. Safety comes first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_7@Yes... I'm sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_8@That’s it for today. You’ve worked hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_2_9@Hey... Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_1@Coach... It’s time to wake up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_10@... Arghhhhhhhh!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_12@Come on, coach, say ah.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_13@I...I can eat it myself!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_14@It’s all right~ Come on, say ah~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_15@... Ah.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_16@Hehe, it’s a rare holiday today, so you can act spoiled today and rest~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_17@O...OK...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_18@Tsk, I can't watch this anymore! What's going on? Look at player! See how bewitched he is!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_19@She's snatching Coach away from us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_2@Huh...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_20@Is that coach’s type...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_21@Honestly, why is everyone like this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_22@Coach, why don't I clean your ears for you? Here, rest on my thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_23@What? Really?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_25@It seems like we need coach to understand the importance of treating everyone the same and not having favorites!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_27@Hehe... I feel so happy today...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_28@Oh, Akane, can you help me with something...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_3@Good morning, coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_30@... Why is she acting like Rina? What happened?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_31@Saki, do you want to go on a stroll with me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_32@Saki is very disappointed at you...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_33@S...Saki? Even Saki is like that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_34@Nadeshiko, do you know what’s up with them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_35@Oh? Do you need me? I thought you only needed your mother?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_37@That’s not it. She’s not my mother... Wait, that’s not the point... You guys...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_38@Oh, that’s great! Then I can have coach all to myself?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_39@Mrs M...Misako?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_4@Woooaaahhhh!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_40@Humph!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_41@... Hey!! Wait up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_5@Mrs. Misako, why are you here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_6@Hehe, to wake you up, of course. I made breakfast. Come eat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_7@Come on, I'm not a little kid. I can wake up myself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_8@Hehe... That’s right, you sure aren't a kid.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_3_9@Misako covers her mouth while laughing, her eyes staring right at my crotch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_1@Coach... Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_10@Misako turns around, showing me her chest that is threatening to pop out the buttons of her shirt. I think I can even see the color of her skin through the gaps.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_11@This... This is too much!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_12@So that really was the case... What a shame, I really liked this shirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_14@Mrs Misako?! Why did you climb so high?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_15@Coach... It isn't easy to clean the places up here, and thought that it would be difficult for Kana, so I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_16@Watch out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_18@Misako falls, and I rush over to catch her. She falls into my embrace.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_19@I feel something warm and soft fall into my arms, and especially feel the pressure of two massive but soft objects pressing against my chest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_2@Mrs Misako? What is it? Um...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_20@I have an urge to hug her tight, but before I act, I can feel some scathing eyes looking at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_21@...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_22@!!!! (Since when were they there?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_23@Ahem, well... Mrs. Misako, why don't you get up first...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_24@Sure...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_26@... Mrs M...Misako? I have something to discuss with you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_27@Oh? Sure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_29@What's on your mind, coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_3@I walk in the direction of the sound, only to see Misako with her back bared to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_30@Well... Mrs Misako, you’ve been a bit overboard recently... Er... Can you tone it down a little?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_31@... Do you hate it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_32@... No, that’s not it! It’s not that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_33@That's wonderful! I don’t know what I would do if you hated me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_34@(She is super cute...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_35@Actually... I think I've fallen in love with this place.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_36@Umm…?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_37@My lively team mates and my gently coach... Everyone is living together so happily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_38@Although we won’t be able to be together forever, I hope I can create short but wonderful memories here, just like at a summer festival.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_39@Mrs Misako...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_4@I'm sorry, can you help me pull up the zip at the back?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_40@So... I want to create more memories. That’s okay, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_41@... (I can't say no to that!!!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_43@Coach~ It’s time to eat~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_44@Oh, thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_45@Do you want to have coffee, tea, or me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_46@Eh…!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_48@Er... Er...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_49@Hehehehehe!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_5@Um... S...Sure...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_50@I...I’m innocent!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_6@Oh... ah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_7@The zip seems to be caught on something and it made Misako moan in discomfort, but the sound makes one’s thoughts wander.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_8@Er, I'm sorry... I can’t seem to pull it up... Is this all right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_4_9@Oh no... I think I’ve put on weight. Look, my chest is so tight. player, do you think I'm forcing it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_1@I had a dream.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_10@I try to break loose, but Misako’s soft body weighs down on my legs, rendering my unable to move.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_11@I lower my head and see the breasts I had fantasized about fully exposed before me. They are so full and round, and the feeling of her breasts pressing against my cock is more delightful than I imagined.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_12@Blood rushes up to my brain, but I manage to say something before I lose my rationality.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_13@Don't do this! Your husband...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_14@Don't say something like that~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_15@Misako squishes her boobs together a few times, pretending to be punishing me, and I stop resisting at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_16@Let me do something nice to you? Look, even your little friend down there looks like he’s enjoying himself. It doesn't count as cheating if it doesn’t go in, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_17@Although I know it’s just a technicality, I can't seem to think straight with my cock held hostage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_18@Ah... It’s so hard and hot... Young cock is the best... This is the smell of a horny man... This is what I wanted...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_19@Misako sniffs my cock greedily as she presses her breasts against it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_2@In my dream, I was surrounded by the sweet smell and softness of a woman, and amorously laughter filled my ears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_20@The kind and gentle Mrs Misako seems to have become a different person, and doesn’t hide her desire for my cock at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_21@Mrs Misako’s body also seems to be craving my cock as her nipples have already become firm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_22@I should take advantage of the situation to knead her giant breasts, but the scene in front of me is too erotic. I actually couldn’t move like an excited virgin doing it for the first time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_23@It’s all right. Mommy will help you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_24@As if she can read my mind, Misako looks at me with a bewitching but kind gaze.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_25@She kneads her breasts left and right. Her soft breasts become all sorts of erotic shapes as they rub against my firm cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_26@Hmm…… Yes……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_27@A lot of transparent pre-cum leaks out from the tip of my cock, and I start to hear squishing noises when her breasts press onto my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_28@Look... You’ve become so wet from this. You're so cute...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_29@Aaaahhh... Mrs... Misako...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_3@This woman crouched on top of me, and I felt my cock awaken from gentle touching.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_30@Don’t hold back. Mommy will clean you up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_31@The transparent liquid that covers her breasts are like an aphrodisiac. Her aureole has become so swollen by now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_32@Misako has even started to wave her plump ass in anticipation. If I reach out and touch her pussy now, I bet it is hot and moist, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_33@Ah... More of it is spilling out... How cute...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_34@Do you want to cum? You can cum any time... Take this~ Rub rub rub...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_35@Under her teasing, my cock can no longer hide its desire to explode.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_36@I can’t take it any more. This boob job from the giant breast of a slutty milf is just too intense.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_37@Aaahh! I'm going to...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_38@Before I cum, I suddenly think—It’s definitely immoral to cum like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_39@I know she's a married woman, but I'm still about to cum from her boob job...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_4@This isn’t right. This feels a bit too real...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_40@Surprisingly, the feeling of doing something immoral makes me even harder than before.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_41@Come on, give me everything you’ve got—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_43@My cock shoots my cum with amazing force, sending spurt after spurt of semen all over Mrs Misako's face and breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_44@Ah... I came from having cum fired all over me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_45@Mrs Misako smiles in satisfaction with all my cum around her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_46@The smell of cum is the best...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_5@Mm... Mm... Huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_6@I open my eyes to find myself lying down in my bed, but that feeling did not belong to a dream...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_7@Because Mrs Misako was naked and between my legs, with my cock sandwiched between her giant breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_8@Good morning, player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h1_9@Now isn’t the time to say good morning, right!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_1@Late at night, I’m deep asleep when I’m awoken by a rustling noise.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_10@player... You will fill my slutty pussy with your cock, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_11@I don't think there exists any man who can resist Mrs Misako when she’s like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_12@I reach out and grab her breast, and she moans with great excitement.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_13@Mrs Misako, you're such a slut and these breasts are slutty too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_14@I grope her breasts with abandon, enjoying the soft touch. Whenever I see her huge breasts wobble and change shape, my blood races inside me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_16@Mrs Misako seems to be enjoying this greatly too, as she trembles each time my fingers slide by her nipples.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_17@I intentionally tweak, rub and pull her nipples, and Mrs Misako moans loudly in response each time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_18@Aaahhh...! What a lewd technique... You’ve gotten better after growing up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_19@That side... Yes... It’s so good... Do it more...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_20@I’m just playing with your breasts. You're a bit too aroused by this, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_21@Because she’s sitting on top of me, I can see very clearly that her pussy is already soaking wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_22@I can also see that there’s a gap on her panties so that I can fuck her directly without taking them off.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_23@How... How erotic is this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_24@You’re getting so aroused just by having your breasts touched, and you're even tempting me with this type of clothing. If that's the case, it shouldn’t matter if I just stick my cock in, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_25@I lift her ass and plunge my firm cock into her hot and moist pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_26@Oh! It's in... This is it... Aaahhh... You're filling me up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_27@It’s amazing how much you're enjoying this sudden thrust!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_28@To punish her, I lift Mrs Misako’s body up high and lower her down completely so that my cock thrusts deeply into her from the head to the base of the shaft each time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_29@After a few thrusts, Mrs Misako has lost her reason and moans in ecstasy on top of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_3@Aware that something is happening, I throw off my blanket.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_30@This is it... I love sex... But that person won’t do it with me at all... Aahhhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_31@The room is filled with the sounds of our bodies slapping together and her moaning. Her lewd body and addiction to cock makes me so excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_32@But that’s not all. Her soft walls stimulate the most sensitive parts of my cock. It’s like she exists just to pleasure men and make crave more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_33@I’m sorry, my dear husband... But I can't give up something that feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_34@Yes, Misako’s husband is clearly in the wrong! Such an erotic woman must be fucked every day!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_35@Like a beast, I thrust into her again and again. Our love juices fly everywhere and we're both completely drenched down there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_36@More.. More...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_37@Give me more cock...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_38@The room is filled with the sounds of our bodies slapping together and her moaning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_39@Although it’s possible that others will hear us making so much noise late at night, but we can’t stop now even if we’ll get caught cheating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_4@Oh, good morning, player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_40@Aaaaahhhh... I’m going to cum... A cock that doesn’t belong to my husband is fucking my brains out—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_41@Mrs Misako’s pussy clenches super tight, and I explode deep inside her with a low growl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_43@Misako's moans lewdly as she climaxes powerfully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_44@Aaaahh... Aaahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_45@Misako’s body trembles gently as she recovers. I wanted to let her lie down to rest, but she pushes down onto me, preventing me from moving.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_46@Wait...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_47@She wiggles her ass gently and I a moan escapes my lips as her pussy sucks on my cock inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_48@We both know that my cock is about to get up again. Misako looks at me with satisfaction and licks her lips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_49@Shall we continue?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_5@Mrs Misako is sitting on top of me, wearing erotic underwear that covers nothing, expressing her naked desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_6@Mrs Misako... You aren’t even trying to pretend anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_7@Because just my breasts is not enough... The smell of cum makes me want even more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_8@Mrs Misako seems to have become a different person as there is no trace of that gentle and caring side of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_h2_9@Her alluring body radiates female hormones, and her flushed face and moist gaze all betray her desire for cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_1@The opponents we faced today were very powerful. Even though our members had done everything they could, we still lost the game.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_10@Miss Misako?! Whe-When did you come?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_11@Did she hear me murmuring... all those things?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_12@Misako slowly walks towards me without answering my question. The breeze in the night brings the warm fragrance on her to my face, which dazzles me a little bit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_13@Then I feel warmth on my head. That's Misako, who is patting on my head with a smile on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_14@Coach is a really great man.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_15@... You don't have to comfort me like that. I know I'm just an immature guy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_16@Isn't that great? Being immature means there's still space to be improved.\nOnly when one is in his youth can he simply work hard while simply looking at his aim.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_17@When Misako's fingers softly come to the back of my ear, I feel drunk with a boiling feeling in my ear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_18@Meanwhile, however, in Misako's eyes, other than the reflected night scene, I see some kind of depression I can't understand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_19@Beneath the clear night sky and surrounded by the smell of beer and some chemistry, Misako and I just stand like that for a long, long time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_2@After comforting the members and explaining the strategy for the next match, I ask them to go to sleep and take some beers up to the roof alone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_3@Stars can even be seen clearly tonight... The perfect weather for a sad man to get drunk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_4@I crack open a beer and swig it back with the wind breezing through my face.\nThe tingling bubbles can freshen my throat, yet they can't wash away the depression in my heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_5@Aah... I'm such a failure as a coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_6@I could see the weakness in the opponent but I couldn't apply to it in time... No, I should say, no one in our team was able to apply to that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_7@So it means, I'm missing something in their regular training... Sigh.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_8@Liquor doesn't taste so good when drinking alone, huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_1_9@I turn around and see Misako smiling at me by the door to the roof.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_1@To pass the message from the director, I come to Misako's room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_10@I haven't spent time looking at it for a long time. I miss it so much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_11@Miss Misako. This man...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_12@You also noticed that, didn't you? Coach looks a little like how my husband looked when he was young.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_13@So it is he. Even though the outline of the face hasn't changed so much, the auras of that man in the photo and the director now are completely different... I didn't recognize him at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_14@He was also just an innocent man like Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_15@... But that man is already lone gone, gone to the other side of the river called time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_16@Despite the smile on Misako's face, when she says that, her eyes are brimming with grief.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_17@I suddenly recall how Misako looks when she said she "wanted to find the feeling of being a young girl again."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_18@(In addition to fearing to age, could it be that Misako is also looking for the shadow of her younger husband, who no longer exists?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_19@My mind is bombarded with complicated feelings and they're about to burst out.\nWith my teeth clenched, I leave Misako's room and close the door for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_2@Miss Misako── She's not here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_20@Until I close the door and leave, Misako hasn't raised her head at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_3@Hm? This is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_4@I walk towards Misako's desk and pick up the photo frame on it. In the photo stands the younger Miss Misako and...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_5@Hm? This person... looks like me so much...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_6@When I'm staring at that man whose arm is around Miss Misako's waist, someone giggles behind me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_7@It seems that Coach has found something interesting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_8@Mi-Miss Misako!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_2_9@The stupefied me turn around and let Misako take away the photo from me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_1@Coach, my husband wants to invite you to our home for dinner.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_10@Honey, I’ve prepared beer for you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_11@Thank you, Misako.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_12@Misako is such a gentle and diligent wife, and she’s showing off how lovey-dovey she is with her husband in front of me. But for some reason, something feels strange about their seemingly perfect husband-wife interaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_13@Misako loves... the husband in the past, doesn't she? But now that her husband has changed, what is she thinking about when she says all those words?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_15@The director collapses on the table completely drunk on his second can of beer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_16@I’m sorry, Coach, my husband wanted to chat with you but he’s dozed off like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_17@It's okay. The dinner tastes wonderful. Thank you so much for having me here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_18@... It's has been a long time since the last time someone complimented the meal I cook. player is such a good boy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_19@If you like it, I can compliment you as much as you want.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_2@So here I am at Misako's to have dinner with the couple.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_20@Eh...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_21@I seriously look at Misako's surprised expression that she rarely shows.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_22@I'm merely a Coach who can merely try his best to provide each member the best environment for them. If innocence and compliments are what Misako needs, then it's the best, because those are things I can give.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_23@── So, stop showing that kind of sad face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_24@Misako is transfixed when tears flow down from her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_25@I want to wipe off  her tears, but my hand reaching towards her is grabbed by Misako in the air. She then places my hand on her soft chest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_26@Despite the tears that stream out nonstop, a mild and gorgeous smile slowly bloomed on Misako's face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_27@player... Ahh... I'm such a lucky girl to be on your team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_28@Misako's husband starts snoring. I feel a sense of guiltiness in my mind, but it is soon flushed away by my pity for Misako.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_29@So I reach my arm out to put it around her shoulder── just like how the young director did to Misako in that photo.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_3@Ah! You’ve arrived, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_4@Greetings, director! Your wife was so gracious to invite me and I’m simply overjoyed at the chance to come...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_5@Hahaha... There’s no need to be so serious. Just make yourself at home.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_6@Sure! Thank you for your generosity. I won't hold back then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_7@I follow the director into the dining room. Argh... My stomach is starting to hurt from my anxiety, and it only starts to ease when I see Misako.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_8@There you are, Coach~ Welcome!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P011_N_3_9@My husband and I have always wanted to chat to you about your team. Why don’t we do that over dinner?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_1@It’s a rare rest day today. I can finally have a good rest at home.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_10@In front of me is a group of neatly lined up tall men wearing a blue uniform.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_11@Hi! Are you player?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_13@I close the door instantly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_14@W-Wait! What happened? Why would the police be visiting me like this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_15@Did someone report me? But this is a government dormitory. Everything should be legal here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_16@... Wait, if everything is legal, why should I be afraid? Damn, am I feeling guilty?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_18@Ding Dong— Ding Dong—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_19@Take a deep breath. At times like this it is more important to remain calm. Anyone would freak out if a group of police appear at their door, right? I believe the police would understand. Okay, I better open the door calmly—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_2@Speaking of it, with the addition of Misako to the team, we’ve now got 11 female members. The team is almost filled with women.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_20@*Clank*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_21@... Are you player? You seem a little anxious. What’s wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_22@Now that I look carefully at them, the police are actually all foreigners. But they’re speaking our language fluently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_23@Ah~ I'm sorry! I was dressed rather casually since it’s my day off, so I went to change my clothes just then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_24@Yes, that’s me. How can I help you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_25@There’s something I want to know. According to the information in the file, you’re the coach of a team, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_26@Yes, that’s right.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_27@The information also says that you can train even the most normal of members into skilled combatants.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_28@No, you flatter me! They all work very hard. All I do is point them down the right path for them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_29@And they all happen to be women.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_3@If I wasn’t the coach of their team, I bet the police would be on my case ages ago simply because I’m living with a group of women in the dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_30@W-What a coincidence... Haha.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_31@And you've brought them all here to this dormitory and live together with them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_32@T-This is part of my teaching plan! I let them see how I live my life so they can learn from it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_34@The police look even more serious than before after hearing my explanation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_35@I’m done for! What crappy reason was that? If the police suspect me, they’ll go and make a fuss with the director. Then my life as a coach will be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_36@Okay, then I don’t think there’s any problem.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_37@It’s a big problem, okay!!... Hmph? I am sorry, what did you say?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_38@You teach women who are physically inferior to men and even teach them by example. Your reputation is justified.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_39@It looks like I can hand “her” to you safely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_4@Sigh... My career as a coach has just begun... I hope there won’t be any strange misunderstandings.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_40@“Her”?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_41@I’m sorry, this is a selfish request. I want you to train my daughter—Riria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_42@A woman walks out from behind several tall men. She forms a stark contrast with these men.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_43@She is like a flower among weeds, which makes her seem even more—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_44@Um... sure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_45@That would be great. Please train her to become an excellent combatant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_46@Beautiful! She’s simply too beautiful! She’s like a painting. This thought fills my head and makes me agree without thinking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_47@However, phew~ So someone just wanted to join the team. And here I was worried that the police really were after me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_48@Now that I think about it, I’m a coach after all. I’m not a suspicious pervert at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_49@Speaking of which, can you explain the situation behind you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_5@Ding Dong—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_51@I turn around. Tomoka is standing behind me with a sleepy look on her face, and all she has on is a shirt...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_52@T-Tomoka!? It’s rare for you to wake up so early~ We have visitors, so g-go put something on. We have some strict training later today!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_53@“Pat” Someone pats my right shoulder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_54@... Mr. Player. Please explain yourself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_6@Hmm? It’s only 7am... I wonder who pressed the bell?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_8@Really now... Is there something urgent? Okay, I’m coming—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_1_9@I walk to the door and open it gently so I can stick my head out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_1@Um, so you're the new member? I'm Yui, It's nice to meet you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_10@Wait up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_11@You guys are going to frighten our new member if you're all so excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_12@Let me explain the situation first. Our new member is called Riria and she’s the daughter of the Russian police officer who was just here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_13@I heard that he sent her here for training so that Riria can graduate from the police academy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_14@But what I don’t understand is, how is our work related with the work of the police?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_15@Oh well. Another person with an powerful background has joined the team. I better not leave her with a bad impression of us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_16@Either way, Riria will be living here from now on... Let’s go buy some daily necessities first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_17@Okay! Let's all go together~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_18@Shopping Street
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_19@That’s right, Riria, what are your hobbies?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_2@I’m Akane, nice to meet you too! What should we call you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_20@I’m sorry, if you ask me suddenly...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_21@Riria, you look really quiet. Do you like reading or writing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_22@Yes. I flip through the books my papa gives me from time to time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_23@Hah, he sounds like a good father who dotes on his daughter. What type of books does he give you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_24@... Self-defense.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_26@I-It looks like your father is really concerned about your safety. How caring of him...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_27@He just a silly papa who doesn’t understand what a maiden thinks!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_28@Oh~ Can you tell me what you're good at? Hmph, I won’t lose to anyone in singing and dancing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_29@Maybe... Not... My papa always tells me that I can do better.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_3@Oh, maybe we should use English...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_30@It’s okay, parents are all like that. Tell me, I want to hear all about it~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_31@Then... What about “systema”?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_32@Oh! That’s a famous Russian martial arts!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_33@That’s a good hobby. It’ll be great if members who are physically strong join us!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_34@Is there anything else?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_35@Yes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_36@Other than that, karate, judo, taekwondo, aikido, boxing, kendo, Thai kickboxing, oh and Chinese martial arts...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_37@That’s it. Those are the only things I’ve learned.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_38@Haha... That isn't bad at all. Now I won’t have to be afraid of bad people.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_39@I wonder what trauma your father has to make his daughter learn all that... (Whispers)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_4@Just speak like usual. I’m, Riria. How do you do!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_40@Can you tell me what you like? D-Don’t tell me you like guns...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_41@No, guns are a bit...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_42@Phew, that’s good! Heh, even if her father has given her such a masculine education, a girl is a girl after all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_43@So~ What do you like? For example, do you like any animals?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_44@Do I... like any animals...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_46@No, nothing. If it has to be an animal, then what about a bear?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_47@You must be talking about bear plushies, right? Hehe, that’s cute of you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_48@... No. Papa usually finds me bears to practice my skills on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_49@Although they're cute and furry, father always tells me to pay attention. Bears are dangerous as it’s really easy to get hurt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_5@Ms. Riria, are you a foreigner? You're amazing! You can speak our language so easily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_51@What's wrong? Everyone made the same expression when I told them this at the police academy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_52@... Riria, have you really fought with bears?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_53@Yes. I've heard that you can even ride on a bear after you subdue it. Except I've never succeeded.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_54@Is that strange? Papa told me that this is really normal in Russia...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_55@How is this normal?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_6@No, I’m half Russian because of my papa. We speak the same language as everyone else here at home.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_7@Oh! So you're multiracial? No wonder you're so pretty!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_8@Hey, let’s go meet the other members. Everyone is interesting here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_2_9@I... I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_1@*Bang!* *Bang Bang*—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_11@She lowers her head and averts her gaze after hearing my question.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_12@Almost everything is full marks in her results. There is only one thing in which she sucks at...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_13@She didn’t even manage to get one point in the “shooting” test. This is worse than a beginner.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_14@Although I know you didn’t do that on purpose, I still want to ask you something. Did you miss on purpose?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_15@I focused on the target, but I don't know why I end up missing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_16@I see. So this is the reason why Riria can't graduate. The team competes mainly in shooting. Her father must have brought her here because of this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_17@Okay then. Stop blaming yourself. Relax, I am your coach and I’ll help you overcome this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_19@Despite this, although I teach Riria all sorts of techniques, nothing seems to work.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_2@Okay, that’s all for today. Riria, go rest on the side first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_20@I’ve tried everything that I can, and Riria also listens very seriously to me. It’s so disappointing that nothing is working...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_21@It's a good thing that the other members all understand her situation and avoid mentioning this. Everyone seems to be getting along well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_22@Mm?! Rina! You stole my pudding again, right!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_23@Who told you to ignore my instructions yesterday. We lost because of that. This is your punishment~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_24@Hey! But you’re not even the captain! Give it back to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_25@Sure, if you can catch me~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_26@Riria, help me catch her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_28@Yikes! When... Argh... O-Okay, let me go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_29@It isn’t good to steal from others. Return it to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_3@...Yes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_30@Hmph! I’ve give it back then. Catch!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_31@What...!? Hey! If you throw it that high, the pudding will...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_33@*Bang!*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_34@Riria jumps up and catches the falling pudding. But her exaggerated rescue also results in her falling on the ground and sliding for some distance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_35@Oh no! A-Are you okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_36@It's all good! The pudding is still okay!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_37@I’m talking about you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_38@Come on... What are you all up to at this hour? We've got class tomorrow, so you should all return to your rooms!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_39@(Yes...) (Hmph!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_4@I just did a basic fitness test with Riria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_40@Riria, are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_41@I'm fine. I made sure to avoid the vitals.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_42@Okay, then don't forget about class tomorrow. I’m going to rest too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_43@Riria nods softly and turns to leave.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_44@Sigh... Class... It doesn’t sound good to say this, but I’m not looking forward to tomorrow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_45@I feel guilty about my inability to help her improve...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_46@It looks like all I can do is get her to practice again and again. Wait... What’s this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_47@Something seems to be on the ground where Riria landed earlier.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_48@Is that a pendant? Surely it belongs to Riria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_49@The moment I decide to chase after her, the clasp breaks open, revealing a picture—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_5@She really wasn’t joking earlier. She's simply the best in endurance, strength, flexibility, response, and focus...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_51@I stop out of reflex. I lower my head in thought. My instinct tells me that this is the key to a breakthrough—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_52@... Why did I forget something this important? All I've done is teach her shooting techniques. I've never tried to understand her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_53@Sigh, I’m such a failure as a coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_54@I take out my phone and leave a message in our group chat—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_55@“Tomorrow’s class will be canceled. Don’t make any trouble for me!”
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_6@She's so outstanding that I don’t know what to say about her. But I seem to understand why her father took her here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_7@Riria, are you feeling unwell anywhere?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_8@No, my body is in good condition.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_3_9@I see...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_10@That’s fine. It’s... It’s just a normal photo inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_12@You won’t carry a normal photo with you everywhere, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_14@Riria makes an indescribable expression when she opens the pendant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_15@But this expression isn't unfamiliar to me at all... Riria makes the same expression whenever she is in shooting practice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_16@In the photo, Riria is hugging a little puppy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_17@Riria is smiling brilliantly in this photo. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile like that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_18@Is that dog your pet? Why didn’t you say anything when I asked if you liked any animals?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_19@Because...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_2@I can't find it today either. Where is it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_20@Can you tell me about it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_22@Ever since I was a little girl, most of my time was spent training under my papa and I rarely got to meet other children of the same age as me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_23@To make up for that, papa gave me a little puppy to keep me company.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_24@And that puppy was my first friend.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_26@Go on. Did something happen?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_27@In the end... I actually hurt him!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_28@During shooting practice one day, he ran toward me suddenly. I was about to pull the trigger at that time and that was how I...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_29@... I see. So that’s why your hand trembles slightly whenever you aim before shooting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_3@Riria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_30@Luckily, we were using practice bullets and I missed his vitals. He recovered very quickly after treatment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_31@So your guilt stopped you from approaching it after that incident.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_32@No! It was because... Eh!? Coach... Why do you know about all this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_33@I’m sorry, I took yesterday off to investigate this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_34@It took me some time to reach your father. I learned a lot about your past from him.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_36@You always thought that he stayed away from you because he was afraid of you. But from your father’s perspective, you were the one keeping your distance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_37@No! He was afraid of me because I... I hurt him.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_38@Is that what you really think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_39@Ah... Urgh! Coach... I've brought him here. Urgh!... D-Don’t run around like that...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_4@Coach... You’re back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_40@Haha, what good timing. Thank you, Akane. Come on, let Riria... Eh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_41@Woof! Woof!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_42@Warghhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_43@The dog Akane brought with her suddenly runs towards us. It is so massive that it knocks me flying...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_44@Woof! Ha... Hahaha... Woof!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_45@T-This dog is...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_46@That's mean of you. He’s so excited, but you don’t recognize him at all? See how excited he is? He doesn’t seem to have forgotten you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_47@This touch... This smell... Could it really be you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_48@Woof!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_49@I heard you entered the police academy soon after that so you probably don’t know what happened after that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_5@I think this belongs to you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_50@Your father sent him to the police hound training center after the incident. So he’s now an outstanding police hound.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_51@... Police hound?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_52@Animals are smarter than humans. After getting hurt, they’ll never approach the thing that hurt them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_53@But he's not the same. Although he was hurt by a gun, he overcame that fear and became a police hound. There’s nothing he fears now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_54@... Is that so? That’s so amazing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_55@Yeah, so... It’s your turn now, Riria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_57@He overcame his fear and became a police hound. I believe you can do the same. Don’t feel guilty about your past. Take a step forward!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_58@I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_59@Riria hesitates. After a while, she reaches out to hug her pet of the past. She strokes his fur and pats him at the same time. Some time later, her hands stop trembling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_6@Oh, so you found it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_60@... Even though I hurt you, you're still willing to come up to me like you used to.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_61@It looks like I was the one doing all the avoiding...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_62@Coach, thank you for telling me this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_63@Riria smiles for the first time after coming here. The smile on her face is exactly the same as the one in the photo.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_64@Will you continue to teach me from now on?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_7@I’m sorry, I borrowed it without asking you. Here you go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_8@... Thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_4_9@There's one more thing I need to apologize for. I’m sorry, I took a look inside without asking for your permission.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_1@It’s night-time and Riria and I are both at the shooting range.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_10@Eh! Coach!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_11@Maintain your posture and don't move.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_12@You haven’t been making any progress so far. I don’t think normal methods will work, so I’m going to use my special training~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_13@Special... training?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_14@Riria, you want to get better at shooting, right? Then no matter what I do, you have to focus on the target.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_16@Riria resumes the shooting position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_17@Her obedient personality coupled with her training in the police academy has made Riria completely obedient to the orders of her superiors.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_18@I reach deeper inside her clothes and start taking her clothes off—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_19@Mmm... Haa... Haa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_20@The moment I touch her skin, she trembles slightly. But she does her best to maintain her stance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_21@Seeing her so serious makes me want to tease her some more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_22@The hand inside her clothes starts to caress her freely. At the same time, I pull out my excited cock and place it between her thighs—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_23@Mm... Haa... Coach, something feels hot between my legs... Haa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_24@This is training to enhance your concentration. No matter what I do, remember to keep your eyes glued to the target.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_25@... I’ve never heard... Aaahh... Of this type of training before... Mmmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_26@That’s why it’s my special training. Okay, I’m going to step it up now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_27@As Riria is always wearing one of those large police coats, I never realized how large her breasts are until now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_28@You can’t always hide your fine body like this~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_29@I knead her breasts as I start searching for my real target a little lower.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_3@Does it still not work?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_30@Riria continues to fidget the whole time and lets out a quiet moan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_31@Riria, now I’m going to show you how to find the target accurately.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_32@Even though I’m only searching with my lower body, I’m able to accurately pinpoint Riria’s pussy. It doesn't even take me a few seconds before I locate my target.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_33@Then I stick my cock deep inside her sweet pussy—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_34@Mmmm....!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_35@Aahhh... S-Something is inside me... Something hot is inside me...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_36@How's this? I only needed a few seconds to find my target~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_37@Coach... Haaa... Haaa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_38@Her pussy was already wet from the previous touching, and it clenches my cock tight every now and then. Maybe she’s quite nervous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_39@Good job! You’ve managed to maintain your stance even now. Keep going.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_4@I'm sorry... You’ve stayed behind with me till this late, but I still haven't made any progress.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_40@Here comes your second learning focus—I'm going to teach you how to relax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_41@As I speak, I start to move my hips so that my cock starts moving inside her—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_42@Aaahhh... Aaahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_43@Aaaaahhhh...! Something hot is moving inside me... Aaaahh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_44@Coach, I... Haaa...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_45@Don’t think at all. Focus on what you're feeling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_46@Mmmmmm... No~! Haaa... Aaaahhhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_47@Our sex fluids mix and flow down her thighs from her crotch. At the same time, the room is filled with the sounds of our bodies slapping together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_48@As I get close to cumming, the pleasurable sensations that have been building up this whole time overflow like a bursting dam—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_49@Riria, this is the last thing I’ll teach you today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_5@I’ve been instructing Riria here since morning. I only wanted to achieve the predetermined threshold score and call it a day, but who would have thought that we would still be here...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_50@—Pay real good attention to it. The key to shooting is to give everything you’ve got when aiming for your target!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_51@Aaaah... Aaaah... Aaaah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_52@Aaaaahhhh...! If you're going to be this rough, I...! Mmmmmm...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_53@Aaaaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_54@Riria’s body arches as her body spasms and she drops her gun onto the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_55@Haa... Haa... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_56@I’ll remember everything you've taught me, Coach... So...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_57@Can we end today’s training here? I... I think I’m a little tired...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_58@Riria’s face is flushed red as she speaks in a fatigued tone. I can’t seem to tell what she is thinking from what she said...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_59@Was that too much for her?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_6@We've tried so many methods already. Maybe we should try another one?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_60@But just as these thoughts flit through my mind, Riria’s face becomes even redder as she speaks in a shy voice—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_61@Um, I think there are some things I still don’t understand. Will you continue to teach me tomorrow night...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_7@Riria, aim at the target again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h1_9@After Riria gets into position, I slip my hand inside her clothes from behind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_1@After the help I gave her that night, Riria seems to have untied the knot in her heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_10@I know. You don’t need to say anything, Riria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_11@I walk towards Riria. As I approach her, I remove my belt and lift her up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_12@Coach... Aren’t I heavy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_13@There’s no such thing. You’re as light as a feather~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_14@The pile of clothes next to her tells me that she had just changed into this shawl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_15@That and the timing of the invitation... I know exactly what she is thinking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_16@Mmm... Mmm... Mmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_17@We kiss for a few seconds and a trail of saliva connects our parting lips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_18@This is just too erotic of her. I never knew this prudish girl had this side.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_19@I start to kiss her in other places, which makes her moan adorably.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_2@From that day on, her shooting scores improved significantly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_20@Aaahhhh... Aaahhhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_21@Yes... Right there...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_22@Her scent paralyzes my brain and makes it impossible for me to think. I can’t hold back any longer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_23@Haa... Haa... Haa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_24@Riria, are you sure it’s okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_25@Haa... Haa... Yes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_26@There’s no need to tell me what to do next.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_27@I reposition my crotch so that I can locate my “target”.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_28@It isn't long before I locate the a patch of wetness. I believe that’s what I’m looking for. Then I plunge my burning hot cock inside her—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_29@Aaaaahhhh...! I-It feels so hot... Coach... Aaahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_3@I wonder why she invited me to her room tonight?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_30@Yes, this feeling is just too amazing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_31@It feels so warm, soft and wet. It feels so good that I can't resist the urge to start moving my hips—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_32@Aaahhh... Aaahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_33@Aaaahhhh...! Coach... Mmmm!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_34@Riria hugs me even tighter than before because she doesn’t know what else she can do right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_35@Riria, did you wear this especially for me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_36@Mmm... Yes... Aaahhhhh... Coach, do you like it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_37@It’s really erotic and I love it. But...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_38@... But what?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_39@I move my head next to her ear and lick her earlobe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_4@*Knock, Knock*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_40@Ah~! C-Coach!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_41@Hehe, what I wanted to say is I love how you look when you’re intoxicated with pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_42@So your ears are sensitive? I’ve found your weakness~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_43@After speaking, I approach her ear again and blow gently into it. Then I kiss and lick it again and again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_44@It goes without saying that my hips are busy the whole time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_45@Mmm... Mmm... Aaahhh...! This feels so good... Aaaahahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_46@Riria is so great when she's so honest. As my hips keep thrusting, I can feel myself getting hornier.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_47@Aaaahhhh... Aaaaaaa...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_48@I think it’s time to move to the last stage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_49@I want to give Riria the strongest impact at the height of her pleasure. Which is why I keep up the pace of my thrusts and prepare to get a little rougher—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_5@Riria, I'm coming in.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_50@Aaaaahhhh...! No... I can’t think at all when you do this... Aaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_51@Same here. I just want to feel more pleasure right now... Urgh, I think I’m almost at my limit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_52@My attention gathers at my crotch as my cock swells up to the limit inside Riria. Finally—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_54@I-I’m cumming... Aaaaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_55@As Riria makes a high-pitched scream, I shoot a massive load of cum inside her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_56@I fill her up with so much semen that it overflows and spurts out from the gaps between my cock and her pussy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_57@Haa... Haa... Haa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_58@... Oh no, will we wake the others if we’re so loud?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_59@Hehe, why are you worrying about this right now? If you're worried about that, why did you ask me to come here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_6@The sight in front of my eyes shocks me the moment I enter the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_60@Um, because... I-I didn’t expect you would be so... Ah~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_61@Riria lowers her head in embarrassment and can’t finish her sentence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_62@Haha. Either way, let’s come up with a reasonable explanation for this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_7@... Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_8@Riria is clothed in a thin shawl that is so transparent I can see her completely naked body underneath. This scene ignites the flames of lust within me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h2_9@Um, you must be really surprised by this. Well, I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_1@Wow~ I didn’t expect it to pour like this all of a sudden.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_10@In that case, it’ll be fair if you bathe with me... Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_11@What...!? Really...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_13@There’s no reason for me to reject Riria's unexpected invitation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_14@... Coach, don’t we have to wash our bodies first?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_15@Riria, who has received police training since a young age, seems very accustomed to bathing together in a group. She strips herself without any hesitation after entering the bathroom.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_16@But that’s obviously not what I’m thinking... I start to feel horny when I see her naked body. How could I possibly let this opportunity go?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_17@I push Riria against the wall and make her stand with her back facing me. That's what led to our current situation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_18@Hehe, this is a good position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_19@As I speak, I caress her ass mischievously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_2@Coach... Are you okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_20@Aaahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_21@Oh? All I did was touch you gently~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_22@N-No... I’m just a little surprised.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_23@Really? So if I do this to you, will you also be surprised?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_24@I place my fingers around her pussy lips and glide them around her pussy teasingly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_26@This is more like it. Were you really just surprised?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_27@This is great because the mirror lets me see your expression even though I’m behind you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_28@Aaaaahhhh... Aaaahhhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_29@I can tell from your expression that you're really enjoying this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_3@I’m alright. It’s because you carried me to this hotel on your back... You really are strong.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_30@No, No...... I... Aaaaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_31@I can't let her have all the fun. It’s my turn now. I slide my unbearably hard cock inside Riria sweet pussy slowly—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_33@Aaaaahhhhhh! Coach, your cock is so hot... Mmm... Mmm...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_34@This is simply amazing. I start moving my hips in great anticipation of what will come next.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_35@Ahh... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_36@Yes... Mmm... Mmm...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_37@Oh~ Does it really feel that good?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_38@You actually invited me to have a shower with you and you're even making such lewd noises now. I never realized you were such a sex pervert~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_39@No, I was just...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_4@Really? Coach, if you’re fine, then I’ll... Achoo!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_40@There’s no need to say anything. Just look at your expression right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_41@Mmm... I... Aaahhhh... Aaaaahhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_42@I... Haa... Is... Is this the expression I’m making right now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_43@That's right. This is what you’re really like on the inside. You’re such a sex pervert.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_44@I... Aaahhh... Am I a sex pervert...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_45@If you don’t believe me, then let’s see what happens next—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_46@Without finishing my sentence, I start thrusting my hips faster to give her greater stimulation—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_47@Aaaaahhhh...! No... If you do that... Aaaahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_48@... I’m actually enjoying myself so much as I watch you ravage my pussy like this... Aaaahh... Maybe I...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_49@Maybe I really am a sex pervert... Aahhh... Coach, please scold me! Punish me for being so naughty... Aaaaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_5@Look at you! And you just said you were fine. It’s because your clothes are all wet. Why don’t you have a bath first? You’ll get sick if you don’t.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_50@Heh, don’t worry. I like you no matter what you're like.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_51@I even feel like rewarding you for being such an honest girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_52@... Reward... Me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_53@Make sure you enjoy this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_54@I start thrusting as hard as I can. As my cock slides in and out of her pussy, I can feel the pleasure building up inside me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_55@It isn't long before I reach my limits.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_57@Aaaahhh—! It feels more intense than before... Coach, is this my reward? It feels so good... It feels really good...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_58@Aaaaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_59@As Riria makes a high-pitched scream, my cock explodes with a massive load of cum inside her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_6@B-But the superior officer should go first...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_60@Haaa... Haaa... Haa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_61@Coach... Thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_62@Hmm? Why are you thanking me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_63@It’s because of you that I seem to understand myself better now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_64@Please continue to take good care of me... Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_h3_7@I’m your coach, not your superior officer. Go now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_1@At midnight, light but steady footfalls are reverberating in the dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_10@How shameful... I still have to strengthen my adaptability... I get up to patrol the dorm thinking that it's better to get familiar with the environment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_11@That's the daughter of a police officer. How reliable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_12@You're exaggerating.\nIs Miss Yui practicing dancing here also because of insomnia?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_13@It's not because of that. I just don't have time to do it in the daytime... And I really want to do well in both our team and my idol career.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_14@So that's how it is. So Miss Yui has gained confidence in singing and dancing from constant practice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_15@What?! Well... I was just joking while saying I wouldn't lose to you on singing and dancing when you first came... Sorry. Did I offend then?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_16@You didn't. The reason why you can stand on the stage is because of the great quantity of practice, isn't it? I admire you a lot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_17@Haha. Riria is also very diligent. That's great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_18@With a shiny smile, Yui reaches out a hand to Riria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_19@Looks like we can become very good friends. Next time when you have time, could you teach me how you train your body?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_2@Clack, clack. From the left to the right, when the footfalls almost go around the dorm, they suddenly stop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_20@Riria hesitates in shock for a while, and bashfully holds the soft hand with hers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_21@If you don't mind... let's exchange the training techniques together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_3@In front of the stopped boots, some light is revealed from the crack-opened door of the practicing room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_4@The boots wearer hesitates for a while and pushes the door open. The music that is intentionally played at a low volume soon comes into her ears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_5@... Miss Yui?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_6@Yui turns around and sees the boot wearer walking into the practicing room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_7@Riria? Why are you still up?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_1_9@I didn't expect Riria to have insomnia. I thought you have a fixed daily routine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_1@Bang! Colorful confetti is shot into the air.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_11@Is that a bad idea?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_12@Well... I'm afraid that "feeling surprised" doesn't mean "wanting to do so"...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_13@It's totally a bad idea. Dump it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_14@I-Is that so?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_16@After finally finishing all the work and getting back to my room, I find something on my desk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_17@White lily? Who is it from?... Hm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_18@Under the white lily lies a pretty white envelope with a light fragrance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_19@Isn't it Riria's handwriting? Let me see...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_2@Afternoon Tea Party to Celebrate Riria's First Time Hitting the Bull's Eye has now begun~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_20@Thank you for taking care of me. I don't know what to give you in return. If Coach is willing to grant me the honor, I want to invite you to my home...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_21@What? Does it mean she's inviting me to her place?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_22@At the moment I realize what the letter is about, the fragrance from the letter ambles into my nose. From that fragrance, I can almost see that elegant lily-like girl blooming a shy innocent smile at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_3@After the reunion with the police hound, Riria's shooting skill has improved a lot. That's great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_4@Guys, thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_5@Even though I really don't want to admit it, player is still pretty useful in this incident. It's all thanks to him this time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_6@I want to present something to Coach to thank him.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_7@Have you decided what you're giving him?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_2_8@Yes. When we first met, Coach seems to be surprised that I can ride a bear, so I want to invite him to challenge a bear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_1@To spend the rare holiday, the girls decide to hang out together in a cafe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_10@... Hmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_11@What are you talking about? It's such a small deal. If you're not used to it, just get used to it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_12@Catching Riria off guard, Rina pushes her into the bunch of animals.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_15@Shush! Stop scolding me! Look!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_16@Riria kneels on the ground looking at the cat by her leg stiffly.\nCompletely different from Riria's nervousness, that tabby just gives her a lazy glance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_17@── And lightly jumps up onto her lap.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_18@Wahh! It's up there!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_19@Riria! Pat it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_2@There's a cat!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_20@... Okay.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_21@...! It's s-so soft...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_22@As if some sort of switch in them is turned on, the cats start to gather around Riria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_23@Riria... is surrounded...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_24@She looks happy there. That's great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_25@Riria, sitting in the middle of the cats, blooms a slight yet genuine smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_3@And there are also dogs and rabbits over there... Seems like it's an animal cafe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_5@Riria, is it okay for you? Aren't you afraid of small animals?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_6@No, I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_7@She's just not used to being with them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P012_N_3_9@Coach said that Riria liked small animals, yet she hadn't been with them for a long time.\nSo my guess is... Riria just doesn't know how to show her love to them. Am I right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_1@This should be the place... My investigations over the years weren't for naught...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_10@I can't resist burying my face into Senpai's old clothes. When I take in Senpai's smell, I can imagine he's right next to me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_11@Hah~ N-no, this is only the first item. If this goes on... I'm afraid I won't be able to control myself... W-what else is there to find?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_12@Some meeting minutes... purchase receipts... Hmm, I'll just put these in my bag...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_13@I'll make sure to sort Senpai's recyclables for him. Gotta make sure Senpai recycles properly. Seeing how Senpai is living by himself, we can't have his neighbors thinking that he doesn't know how to recycle. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_14@Hmm... Wait a second... what is this...? A crumpled used tissue...? It's sticky... Could it be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_15@It should be... s-snot... I guess I'm overreacting... \nNext up is...l-lace p-panties?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_16@T-there's no way this is Senpai's... Doesn't Senpai live alone? \nThen... w-which skank does this belong to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_17@I can't believe it... My good mood is completely ruined by the panties... This woman... how dare she hassle my Senpai... Senpai must be troubled as well. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_18@This nuisance of a woman that is disrupting the peaceful life of Senpai and I... I must find her... and... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_19@If that's the case... Then just for today... I'll be Senpai's personal bodyguard... Any girl that dares bother my Senpai, can't be forgiven! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_2@It's been about 4 years since we last met... This time... I definitely won't let you leave my side... Definitely... Never again... Forever and ever... Hehehe~ 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_20@...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_21@There he is... It's the weekend, so he shouldn't be hurrying to his job... Could it be... he has a part-time job? Unless...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_23@I knew it... He's meeting with a woman...! This girl... seems familiar, but anyone that stands between Senpai and I must be removed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_24@It was at this moment, that under the double stimulation of rage and jealousy, large amounts of adrenaline started coursing through Yandere Chan's body and altering it. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_25@You're such a pain~ Did you forget everything I told you already?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_26@It's all a misunderstanding~ I just forgot the date and what I'm supposed to buy. See, aren't I coming to you for help now? As long as I have my little secretary, Akane, I'll be fine.   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_27@You... I don't know what to do with you...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_28@I can hear them now...?! And... I can see even clearer...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_29@It's almost like I can picture the woman's appearance, breathing, even her heart beat in my mind... Is this... a power I gained because of the strength of my love towards Senpai?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_3@In order to calm my excitement, I took a deep breath... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_30@Let me think... I remember last time Yui mentioned that she likes cute and shiny trinkets.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_31@Ohh~ I wouldn't expect less from our honorary team manager~ The kind, capable, and knowledgeable Akane~ You immediately remembered our discussion from a past conversation!  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_32@Heehee~ Stop with the flattery. Your praises won't work on me~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_33@Hey~! W-Watch out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_34@Ahhhhh~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_35@Huh... I-I'm fine...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_36@Whew~ Good thing I was able to react in time, but even so... Akane... did you... gain weight recently?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_37@S-Stop bringing up my weight! If you keep on going on about it, I won't help you pick out a gift!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_38@Hey~ D-Don't go! Akane~~~ Wait for me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_39@Damn it... Does that woman have no shame...?! How dare she lose her balance on purpose so that my Senpai would be forced to defile his clean hands when catching her filthy body!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_4@As I look at the sky, I can barely open my eyes in the glaring sun. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_40@Can't... be forgiven...! \nI must do something to warn this bitch to back off...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_41@How about this? I'm sure Yui will like it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_42@Uh huh~ That's a great gift. I'm sure Yui will like it too~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_43@Then~ when we're done shopping, do you want to go grab a drink~ I know a place with nice dim lighting... and very little customers...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_44@player... I think there's a misunderstanding...! We still need to go over next week's team schedule later! Stop thinking about weird things all the time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_45@What are you talking about, Akane... You were leading me on not too long ago...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_46@Stop it... Now's not the time... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_47@Ahh... It hurts...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_48@Akane... Are you alright? Let me help you up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_49@Sigh... I keep tripping or getting knocked over today... I guess I should've just stayed at home today...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_5@The azure sky, pure white clouds, the color of my surroundings are so much more vivid than I remembered them to be... 
I knew that only when staying by Senpai's side can I fully experience this world... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_50@Although the kid that bumped into me needs to be taught some manners! How could she run off without even saying sorry!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_51@Hmph... Right now... in order to clear all obstacles... I am willing to do anything...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_52@Kid...? I saw that it was a girl... especially evident from her round plump ass that bounces when she runs... It's definitely the shape of a girl that is well endowed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_53@Where do I even begin to roast you... Now that I think about, if we could get that kid to join our side, we could use her speed to our advantage. We are missing...  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_54@Yes, I was just about to say that! We are indeed lacking a curvy girl like her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_55@C-can you think of something else for once...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_56@Akane... Your clothes... when did you rip them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_57@H-hey you're right... my sleeve... where I was just bumped into. There are rips on my sleeve and near my waist... Was this intentional? DId the kid have a knife...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_58@Hehehe~Tremble in fear... You disgusting girl, stay away from my Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_59@Akane, it seems this place isn't safe. I don't know what that kid is trying to accomplish, but let's get out of here first!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_6@Now... It's time to start investigating what Senpai's been up to recently...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_60@Sure... But, why so sudden...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_61@Shhh... Save the questions for later. Quickly, follow me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_62@Tsk... How dare she still keep harassing my Senpai! I can't believe they are holding hands... That skank! It seems my warning wasn't enough!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_63@They sure left in a hurry... But nothing can escape my eyes now, that skanky woman is just around the corner! I see everything!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_64@This time, I'll be sure to give her a warning that she won't be able to forget so easily!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_65@I caught you now! Didn't think it would be me, huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_66@S-Senpai... So, so close to me... Senpai in the flesh... Right in front of me...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_67@Y-you are... I remember you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_68@Yandere Chan... is that you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_69@Senpai... Y-you still remember me...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_7@I open the plastic bag that was in front of Senpai's door, inside is an assortment of various objects that Senpai had used before. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_70@Clang—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_71@player, this box cutter fell from Yandere Chan's hand... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_72@This kid... Akane.. Let's bring her back and ask her some questions... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_8@Some people would call this garbage, but I believe differently. All of these objects were once used by Senpai and then thrown out. These were all once essential objects in Senpai's daily life...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_1_9@Uh huh~ This is Senpai's shirt, it has Senpai's unique smell on it~ Of course the smell would be a bit stronger, seeing how Senpai is a male and also a sports coach~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_1@I take Yandere Chan back to the dormitory and have her apologize to Akane... I also take the time to understand how she has been these past couple of years. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_10@Akane has an awkward smile on her face. After all, she has to introduce the newest member of the team, Yandere Chan... \nwho was a neighbor but also someone that we had problems with.    
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_11@Um... Good job, everyone! Nice training session! Here, we have a new member to our team, Yandere Chan~ 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_12@H-hello everyone... I, I'm Yandere Chan... P-pleased to meet you all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_13@Yandere Chan is a little shy... So... she isn't the best at expressing herself. I asked Yandere Chan to join the team. Hopefully everyone will be able to get along...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_14@Oh~ Are you the latest familiar my soulmate has summoned? I am the Scarlet King, a.k.a. Wielder of the Arcane Eye, Alice!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_15@Come~ kneel and kiss my hand, and I will consider you a member of the team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_16@I am Itsuki, a member of the team. I am also master's personal bodyguard... Welcome to the team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_17@I-I'm Riria, I'm skilled in combat techniques, but still training my shooting skills... I heard that you are proficient in handling weapons... Hopefully, I may have the chance to learn about it from you in the future... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_18@Heyo~ Welcome~ Yandere Chan! As a senior member of the team, I will be rooting for you! \nFeel free to come to me if you have any questions regarding our training~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_19@Ok... and you are?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_2@Yandere Chan was once Akane's neighbor, and I tried to use Yandere Chan's affection towards me to get closer to Akane...  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_20@Oh~ Ahaha~ Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. \nLet me reintroduce myself, I am Yui, a founding member of the team. It's a pleasure to meet you, Yandere Chan~ 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_21@Yui...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_22@Yui... she's the person Senpai and Akane were picking out a gift for...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_23@I always thought that Senpai lived by himself, but after a preliminary introduction of the team members, who knew that he was living with so many... dirty whores... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_24@It's a good thing that these women aren't a large threat... They shouldn't be a problem... if I was serious about getting rid of them. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_25@On the other hand, Itsuki... and Riria... it is evident that they are on a different level... If it comes to pure strength or technique, I won't be able to beat them. I need to be wary of these two...   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_26@Alice... Nevermind... She's just a buffoon...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_27@Yui... She's the one I should get rid of first... I can't believe Senpai would go out of his way to buy her a gift...This skank must be using dirty tricks to keep inconveniencing Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_28@I get angry just thinking about it... How could she keep importuning Senpai... Senpai... Senpai... Senpai.. \nThe only girl Senpai should be looking at is me!! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_29@I must... kill this skanky whore!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_3@Back then, Akane and I already knew that Yandere Chan was acting weirder and weirder... but after Yandere Chan was expelled from school and moved away with her mother, Akane and I lost all contact with her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_31@The dark and heavy murderous intent... is as viscous as the blood of the guilty flowing in hell... this kid...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_33@Itsuki... I have something I want to discuss with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_34@I've been observing Yui for a while now... When she isn't being an idol selling her figure and face on the stage, she spends the rest of her time training in the team...  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_35@Importuning Senpai and betraying the adoration of her fans... This whore... \nKilling her... is definitely the right move... Kill her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_36@Kill her kill her kill her kill her... Kill her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_38@According to her itinerary, she should be heading to a fan meet right now... It's too crowded there, and isn't a suitable place to strike...  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_4@Who would've imagined we would meet again under such circumstances... However... Her breasts... seemed to have developed nicely... I only noticed her ass before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_40@The fan meet is over... Now it's time for dance practice... How can I seperate the dance teacher and Yui in this enclosed space...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_42@Next up is team shooting practice... I thought she was just a pretty vase... Who knew her stamina is quite good... Her itinerary is too full for me to find the right moment to strike.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_43@Hah~ I'm finally done with everything today~ I'm so tired~ I just want to get back home now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_44@Hmm... Should I take a shortcut... I usually don't go here, but today... I guess it's alright. That way I can get back to the dormitory earlier to rest~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_45@She turned into a dark alley... My chance is here... I can finally kill her now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_47@Not on my watch...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_48@You... What are you doing here...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_49@That's becuase I asked Itsuki to trail you... Yandere Chan...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_5@Senpai... I mean, Coach... What are you looking at?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_50@S-S-Senpai... I... Didn't... It's not... I can explain... I just wanted to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_51@Master... What should we do next? Take her into custody or...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_52@No... Let me handle the rest... \nItsuki, follow Yui from the shadows and make sure she gets home safely...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_53@Yes, master... Please be careful too...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_55@S-Senpai... Do you... hate me... \nIf you... hate me... I'll... I'll...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_56@No, there's no way I can bring myself to hate you... Yandere Chan...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_58@What you did was wrong... but it was all because of me... I made you who you are today... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_59@No... Senpai did nothing wrong! Senpai, you are my sunshine... my life... You bring meaning to my existence... Senpai... is the one I love the most... Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_6@Ugh... Such a piercing gaze... She actually noticed me staring at her curvaceous figure... It seems she has an astute observation and dynamic vision...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_60@Alright... That's enough... Yandere Chan, it's alright. Come back with me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_61@Senpai... Your chest... is so warm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_62@It was four years ago when I first met her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_63@Senpai~ Senpai~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_64@How many times have I told you before... Don't be so intimate with me when we're outside, and stop being so loud...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_65@Hehe~ I forgot~ When I see you from afar, I just can't resist calling out to you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_66@Yandere Chan is Akane's neighbor, and also my junior at the same school. We got to know each other because of...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_67@player, how come I keep bumping into you here? \nYandere Chan~ You're here too? How is auntie doing? I haven't gone to visit her in awhile...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_68@Yeah.... She... She's the same as usual... Fine... Everything's fine...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_69@player, did you come to visit Yandere Chan too? Thankfully you come check on Yandere Chan and chat with her every so often, she has become more lively recently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_7@When considering her ability to sneak up on us without us noticing, and to be able to attack Akane... her athleticism shouldn't be a problem...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_70@Hehe... R-R-Right~ I'm here for Yandere Chan...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_71@I lied to them both... I actually wanted to get closer to Akane through Yandere Chan. I yearned for her body and everything of hers... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_72@According to Yandere Chan herself, her father mysteriously disappeared when she was still a child. Her mother refused to speak to Yandere Chan because Yandere Chan's face reminder her mother of the father that left them. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_73@For a while, a gloom surrounded Yandere Chan... She showed zero emotion... and was like a walking corpse...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_74@Senpai~ Senpai~ Are you listening?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_75@Ah... I'm sorry... My mind wandered off... I was thinking of stuff...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_76@Seriously... Senpai, take me to the amusement park again today. I've never been to such a fun place before. If possible I'd like to eat the ice cream you bought last time... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_77@I... but I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_78@player... Didn't you want to take me on a tour of a squirt gun competition? When was that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_79@I think... it's today...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_8@As long as we correct her errant behaviour, she can definitely become the star of our team! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_80@...Senpai...So... You came for Akane today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_81@No... I mean... Yes... but not really...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_82@I'm sorry! I actually bought three tickets! Let's go watch the squirt gun competition together!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_83@Honestly... If you bought extra tickets you should have said so earlier~ Yandere Chan~ Let's go together~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_84@Um... It's ok. I just remembered that I have to run an errand for my mother and do the laundry... \nWhy don't you guys go ahead...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_85@Then... If Yandere Chan says so, Akane, let's go~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_86@But...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_87@It's alright~ Let's just go~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_2_9@So... That concludes our joint new member training~ \nCoach... Would you like to say a few words? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_1@Everyone~ That's it for today's training, good job~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_10@That's right~ Apart from her lightning fast reflexes and physical capabilities, Yandere Chan also has a great understanding of the battlefield and line of sight!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_11@More often than not, whenever Yandere Chan gets sniped, she can dodge the following attacks and find an opening to strike from behind. Only a battle-hardened veteran would be able to pull that off!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_12@Maybe only Itsuki or Riria would be able to accomplish a feat like that in our team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_14@Hey~ Yandere Chan, do you have anything to say? Yui is complimenting you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_15@I-it's not like that... You're over exaggerating...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_16@Come on~ You should just happily accept the compliment~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_17@...tsk...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_18@Hm...?  For a second, Yandere Chan seemed...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_19@It... might just be my shoulder... I injured it... during training...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_2@Ahh~ Training was so fun~ Right~? Rina~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_20@Ohh~ I see~ I thought that you hated me for a second~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_21@Damn it... She's so annoying...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_23@Yui... What is she staring at me for...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_24@Did I... hear you say... D-Damn...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_25@N-no... I was just still upset about my injury... What if I held up team practice?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_26@I-is that so...? How about this, I know a really good doctor. I'll have my agent book an appointment for you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_27@T-there's really no need... I'll see to it myself first. if it worsens, I'll go to a doctor!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_28@Thanks... I'll be leaving now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_3@You're one to talk! Why did you keep targeting me today? Couldn't you pick on someone else?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_30@Damn it... Damn that bitch! I couldn't kill that woman last time. I knew that she would be the largest obstacle between Senpai and I!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_31@Damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it\ndamn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it\ndamn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it \ndamn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_32@Everyday Senpai has to be around a group of such clingy girls... I can tell that his smiles are forced whenever he is laughing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_33@If only all these girls could disappear... All disappear... If I kill them all... If I kill them all... If I kill them all... If I kill them all... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_34@Yet, I can't break my promise with Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_36@If I can't make love to Senpai right now... I guess I could do that instead... Only something Senpai keeps on himself can comfort me now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_38@In order to wait for the opportune time... I wait until all lights have been turned off before coming out... \nGroup life is such a hassle...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_39@But... as long as I can be with Senpai, I should be able to endure anything...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_4@This is revenge for stealing the dessert I put in the fridge again~ Hehehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_40@Hm... Let me see what's in Senpai's bag today...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_41@Ahh~ This... is the tissue we used together... I remember this smell...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_42@There's also the pen Senpai often uses... Yes... today's harvest has been bountiful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_43@Whew... Whew... I got carried away... and accidently helped Senpai sort everything... It seems it took longer than usual...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_44@Longer than usual...? Yandere Chan... what took longer than usual...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_46@N-nothing... I-it's nothing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_47@Stop lying... I've been looking at you from outside the window for over half an hour ago rooting through this trash...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_48@T-trash...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_49@Why are you doing this? You're acting so weird...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_5@Boo~~! So stingy! Next time I'm going to target you too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_50@What... did you say...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_51@I said... you're acting very weird. Nobody intentionally roots through the trash... and picks out these personal items...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_52@It's... kind of... perverted...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_53@What... trash...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_54@Did you say... trash...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_55@Senpai's items aren't trash!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_56@...Wait... W-what's that behind your back...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_57@I will have you... regret calling this trash...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_58@Ahhhhhh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_59@That's enough!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_6@Alright~ I'm just kidding. I'm helpless to Rina's attacks and alluring dancing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_61@Master said... not to hurt each other... during the unannounced drill... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_62@Unannounced... drill...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_63@Yandere Chan, did you forget? I tasked you to act as a weirdo and secretly attack the team members to test their reactions and physical abilities, but you didn't have to go so overboard! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_64@Test...? I-if it's like that... then the thing Yandere Chan is holding behind her back is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_65@It's just a rubber toy, no big deal. Here, Yandere Chan, why don't you give that to me? I'll put it away for you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_66@...Ah yes... Sorry... I lost my cool...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_67@(But... I heard the sound of metal hitting metal when Itsuki threw her shuriken at the ax...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_68@Yui... Sorry for the scare... I should have told you beforehand about the drill...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_69@Yandere Chan, come to my room later... You scared Yui... \nI'm going to have to discipline you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_7@But then again, although Rina is also really skilled, when it comes to reaction speed and physical capabilities... I don't think our team's newcomer would lose to you... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_70@Discipline... Y-yes... He... Hehehe... Discipline... Mhmm~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_3_8@Are you talking about... Yandere Chan?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_1@Whew~ These reports sure took a while to organize...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_10@It was like she completely became a different person and wanted to assault me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_11@Are you hurt?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_12@No... She was stopped just in time by player and Itsuki. player said that it was an unannounced drill... but from Yandere Chan's actions and the weapon in her hand... I think she really wanted to hurt me... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_13@Sigh... that kid... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_14@Akane... I'm really scared...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_15@That kid...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_16@I might have something to do... with the trauma that she suffered from...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_17@What happened...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_18@Yandere Chan's situation is quite complicated. Her father mysteriously disappeared before Yandere Chan was born, and I seldom see her mother out and about... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_19@More often than not, I would see the frail Yandere Chan buying groceries and doing the laundry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_2@But~ finally~ I can have a good rest~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_20@Whenever I saw Yandere Chan, she had a vacant stare and was unsteady on her feet. Even if she bumped into someone, she doesn't react at all... I was always worried that something would happen to her...   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_21@That was until four years ago... when I first met Coach... player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_22@Did he... lay his hands on Yandere Chan...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_23@Heh~ player's motivations at the time weren't exactly pure, but it was thanks to his arrival that Yandere Chan was finally able to break out of her rut...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_24@I personally saw Yandere Chan change from a gloomy kid to a girl that actively dressed up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_25@I understand that feeling! When you want to show your prettiest side to the person that you care the most about and when your efforts are noticed, you'll be giddy for a good couple of days!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_26@Uh huh... player successfully transformed Yandere Chan into how a normal girl of her age should be, spirited... cheerful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_27@Then... what happened... and what does it have to do with Akane?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_28@I later found out that player only approached Yandere Chan... to get to me... but I didn't know back then...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_29@If that's the case... Yandere Chan must be devastated... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_3@Knock knock knock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_30@I only know that one day Yandere Chan was rushed into the ER when she slit her wrists...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_31@How did it come to this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_32@It wasn't until afterwards that I found out player invited Yandere Chan to go to a squirt gun competition. When I appeared, player had no choice but to invite me too...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_33@Afterwards, Yandere Chan said that she suddenly couldn't go. One hour later she slit her wrists and was sent to the hospital...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_34@As my relationship with player became closer, Yandere Chan's situation worsened. I even heard instances of Yandere Chan hurting other students... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_35@As student representative of our school, I had no choice but to intervene. The only problem was that Yandere Chan refused to say a word no matter what I asked her... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_36@The students hurt by Yandere Chan weren't all in the same class as her, or in the same club, but they all had something in common — they all once talked to player before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_37@So then... Yandere Chan went and... But how come you came out unscathed, Akane?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_38@I don't know... it might be because apart from player, I am the only person that ever cared about her...? It also just might be because of this that Yandere Chan was pushed into despair...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_39@She wanted to be with player... but was afraid of hurting the big sis that was also her neighbor and always taking care of her. She had no choice but to back off... but she probably couldn't accept the result...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_4@Hmm? Who could it be... at this hour? \nCome in~ the door isn't locked.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_40@Yeah... that's what I thought too. If I could have found out sooner, maybe Yandere Chan wouldn't be like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_41@What about her mother? Even when things got so out of hand, did she not do anything?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_42@Uh huh... The teacher asked Yandere Chan's parents to come to the school to discuss the problem... but Yandere Chan's mother refused to leave the house no matter what. She even said that whatever happened to her daughter was none of her business...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_43@How could she be so irresponsible...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_44@It can't be helped... I've heard that whenever Yandere Chan's mother sees Yandere Chan, she is reminded of Yandere Chan's father...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_45@So Yandere Chan's mother only provides basic nourishment for Yandere Chan and never expresses concern for anything else. She even beats Yandere Chan... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_46@In the end, too many people were hurt because of Yandere Chan, and things got out of hand. Even the government had to step in, and Yandere Chan was forced to move with her mother and transferred schools...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_47@Afterwards, we never saw Yandere Chan again... All these years, she must have been living such a sad life...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_48@But to invite her to the team just like that... isn't that putting all of us at risk?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_49@player must have his own considerations. Also, according to my observations, as long as player is by Yandere Chan's side, Yandere Chan behaves just like a normal girl...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_5@It's me... Akane... thankfully you're still awake...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_50@Maybe player made this decision because he wanted to cure Yandere Chan...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_51@I guess... I think I can understand... I'll pay more attention to Yandere Chan's actions...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_52@Ok... it's late, you should head to bed soon. We still have training tomorrow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_53@Wait... player told me that if you came to find me, I should give you something before you go...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_55@What is this... thing that Akane gave me? A mud figure? What a weird thing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_56@After listening to Yandere Chan's story... I don't think that she is a bad person... She just has a skewed perspective...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_57@If she can turn back into a normal girl when she's by Coach's side... Hmm... I think I'll make something for Yandere Chan tomorrow... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_58@Right, no girl would say no to sweets!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_59@You filthy bitch... how dare you go about poking your nose into my business...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_6@Yui...? What's up? \nComing to see me so late...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_61@Y-yandere Chan...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_62@Die... No one can save you this time!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_63@N-nooo Ahhhh—!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_64@You shameless woman~ Hahahaha~ I finally got you this time!! \nHahahahahahahahahaha~~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_65@After furiously hacking and slashing for a while, Yandere Chan finally set down the ax in her hand...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_66@Next... what should I do with the body...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_67@This can't be linked back to me, or I won't be able to stay by Senpai's side...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_68@Ahh... I just promised Senpai that I wouldn't hurt any of the team members... How should I face Senpai now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_69@Senpai... If he finds out, Senpai won't give me any more rewards... No... this definitely can't be traced back to me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_7@I heard that you were Yandere Chan's neighbor... Could I ask you some things about her...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_70@Anyways... I need to clean the floor of all bloodstains first...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_71@Hmm...? What... There's no blood...? What's wrong with this woman...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_72@A m-mannequin?! But I remembered killing that bitch, Yui! When did it become a mannequin?! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_73@That's because you fell for my illusion!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_74@W-who's there?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_75@Darker than dusk, redder than blood, I am Alice a.k.a. Wielder of the Arcane Eye!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_76@What...What did you do?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_77@Kukuku~ I just used a little hypnotic suggestion, and had you believe that you were killing a normal girl. \nWhen actually the whole time you were hacking at a log~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_78@The feedback of cutting into wood... is still different than that of flesh. If you had noticed, maybe you would have broken out of the suggestion earlier~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_79@You... I thought you were just some idiot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_8@Yandere Chan! What did she do this time...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_80@It seems I underestimated you from the beginning... but all I have to do now is killing the only witness... and I can still fix the situation!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_81@Kukuku~ Hear my call! Come forth~! My familiar!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_82@I am not your familiar!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_83@Ugh...! I-itsuki...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_84@How many times does this make it now... why do I have to keep cleaning Master's messes... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_85@Kukuku~ Everything is completely in my soulmate's control~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_4_9@Last time I saw her looking sketchy when shuffling through trash that player had thrown away. In the beginning she still wanted to deny it until I mentioned the "trash"...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_1@In the night, I dreamed about the past...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_10@Kill her kill her kill her kill her kill her kill her kill her \nKill her kill her kill her kill her kill her kill her kill her \nKill her kill her kill her kill her kill her kill her kill her \nKill her kill her kill her kill her kill her kill her kill her
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_11@Nooo!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_12@Whew... A dream... it was only a dream...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_13@Mhmm... Smooch... Greetings, Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_14@A tingling sensation suddenly coursed through my lower body...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_15@Yandere Chan! What are you doing here...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_16@I missed Senpai... Last time when Senpai hugged me... and saved me... I felt Senpai's body temperature... and smelled Senpai's smell...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_17@I want to smell it some more... I want to feel more of Senpai... What's so wrong with that...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_18@There's nothing wrong with that.. but... I should...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_19@The tingling sensation once again assaulted me. Yandere Chan took the opportunity to suck my cock as I tried to speak... Her tongue completely envelops the tip of my cock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_2@I had sensed that Yandere Chan had feelings for me back then, but I avoided her due to feelings of guilt...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_20@Hmm~ Senpai... You trying to say something~? Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_21@Yandere Chan gently fondled my balls and put them in her mouth, licking them with her tongue...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_22@T-this feeling... I-it's too stimulating...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_23@So this is Senpai's body... Ahh~ such a strong masculine smell...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_24@I want to... taste you some more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_25@W-where's I-itsuki... Shouldn't she be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_26@Senpai... Even now... why are you talking about other girls...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_27@Nghhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_28@Yandere Chan increased the pressure of her grip on my cock. Her sharp nails slightly dig into my cock... it's a little painful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_29@I have already completely investigated your room... The various alarms in your room have all been disabled by me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_3@Senpai... Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_30@You don't have to worry about that kunoichi... I just asked her to run an errand far far away, of course... I used your stamp to trick her into going...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_31@How did you even find that... It was hidden...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_32@Hehe~ I know everything~ about Senpai... Senpai belongs to me, and me alone... now and forever more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_33@As the ominous words came out of Yandere Chan's mouth, she loosened her hand while using her spit as lubricant, and started licking and stroking my cock with her tongue...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_34@Senpai... I'm begging you... You said that you wouldn't hate me.I just want... to be together with you... Whenever I think about you looking at other girls... it's unbearably painful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_35@Ok... I promise you... I promise...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_36@I had no choice but to make the promise, seeing how the fate of my cock was still in Yandere Chan's hands...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_37@Senpai... your cock... is so hard... and hot... I'm sorry that I hurt it on accident... Let me soothe the pain...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_38@Yandere Chan opened her mouth and swallowed my cock whole...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_39@My cock thrusted in and out of Yandere Chan's mouth, and her tongue continuously lashed back and forth... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_4@Why is there always a group of women by Senpai's side...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_40@As I look at Yandere Chan sucking my cock with a drunken expression on her face, I can't help but be intoxicated by the sight...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_41@Ahh... Y-you're going even faster, Yandere Chan... y-you're so good at this... such skill...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_42@The strong suction of Yandere Chan's pliable and elastic mouth pussy swallowed my cock and rationality...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_43@I-I'm... going to cum... Yandere Chan...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_44@Ahhhhhh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_45@Mhmm... Nghh~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_46@Hah... Hah... Yandere Chan... You caught it all in your mouth...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_47@Heh... So this is... Senpai's... Squelch...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_48@Yandere Chan suddenly increased the suction within her mouth and sucked out the remaining cum in my cock in one go...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_49@Senpai... not a drop has gone to waste... I swallowed it all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_5@Why... Why do you always ignore me... I'm a normal girl too...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_50@Ahhh... What a rapturous taste, Senpai's cock is still so hot... The way it twitches is so cute~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_51@Can this cock... belong solely to me in the future...? Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_52@Suddenly, a bold plan flashed through my mind...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_53@If you can guarantee that you will do your best to adapt to group living, I may be able to... "reward" you every couple of days... What do you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_54@Senpai returned my feelings today... I'm so happy... \nIf it's Senpai that's asking... I'll definitely do my best~ Hehe...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_6@Why do you never look at me... Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_7@I... that's because...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_8@Is it because of Akane? If that's the case... I'll just have to kill her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h1_9@No... No, you can't do that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_1@... Ugh... It, it tingles... Mhmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_10@Kukuku~ My soulmate, I have flawlessly completed the task you entrusted me. I have sealed away the demon, the epitome of envy and lust, that feeds on soul power and the life energy of blood!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_11@I take it you're talking about Yandere Chan... Her memories of assaulting Yui... You erased them using hypnosis, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_12@Of course~ Such rudimentary magic is a piece of cake to the Wielder of the Arcane Eye~ \nHeh~ Now say how amazing I am!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_13@Wow~ You're the best~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_14@Hey~ I won't accept you brushing me off like that! Next time! Next time I'll have you participate in another demon summoning ritual!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_15@Ok ok ok... I understand...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_16@All I want is to get rid of this eighth-grade syndrome, dark magic fanatic right now... Or else things might get out of hand if Yandere Chan wakes up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_17@I have to say, soulmate~ Why are you so bent on protecting this girl...? She obviously has issues...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_18@I... I think I feel like I'm responsible for her. I have to get her back on the straight and narrow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_19@Oh~ What a noble cause... but why would you have me use such lewd suggestions...? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_2@Hehe~ Senpai~ Here. I. Come~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_20@That's because... I believe this is the only effective method!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_21@Hmph~ Soulmate~ I know you too well... You just want to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_22@Sigh~ You can do whatever you want~ Anyways, I've done what you asked of me. The rest is up to your body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_23@Is your... suggestion really effective?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_24@As soon as Yandere Chan has murderous impulses, it is immediately converted into lust towards you... \nAs long as you can bring her to climax, Yandere Chan will forget about her urge to kill and return to being a normal girl...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_25@The suggestion was quite complicated, but my suggestions never fail! \nYou can look forward to it~ Kukuku~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_26@... So... My workload is going to increase by quite a ton...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_27@Senpai... I'm ready already... I'm completely drenched down there...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_28@Hurry... Hurry and reward me... Put it inside me.. Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_29@Everyday I think about your smell... your warmth.. I think about it so much, I'm going crazy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_3@... Uh huh... Where's.. my blanket... So cold...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_30@Yandere Chan positioned the tip of my cock at the entrance of her dripping wet slit as she proclaimed her love... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_31@Ahh~ So, so good... Senpai's cock... So hot and stiff... It's poking me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_32@I can no longer tell if the liquid on my cock is Yandere Chan's love juice or my own bodily fluids. It seems as if our bodies are all prepared to merge together...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_33@I can't hold out any longer... Senpai... I can't... take it anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_34@The opening of Yandere Chan's cunt is tightly pressed against my cock. As her body slowly pressed down, I feel my cock being squeezed into her moist and slippery slit... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_35@Ahhh... Senpai... Finally... Senpai is finally inside me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_36@The pressure from Yandere Chan's walls continuously press down on my cock as if trying to push it out, but it is then instantly thrust deeper into Yandere Chan as she lowers her body...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_37@S-senpai... your cock... is the best... You're driving me crazy... Ahhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_38@I-I'm going to start moving now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_39@As soon as Yandere Chan said that, she starts moving her body up and down...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_4@Ahh~ Poor Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_40@S-senpai... Do you see it? \nYour cock... is thrusting in and out of my pussy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_41@Ahh~ Why... Why does it feel so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_42@Each time Yandere Chan presses down with her body, the nectar from her pussy splashes out, drowning my cock in a sea of love juice...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_43@Ahhh... Senpai... I'm... I'm going to pick up the pace now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_44@Yandere Chan starts shaking her ass even faster, tirelessly like a motor. My cock experiences pleasure it had never felt before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_45@Ahh... Senpai... Senpai senpai senpai senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_46@I-I'm... going to cum... Ahhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_47@Yandere Chan suddenly stops in her tracks and sprawls flat on top of me. A greater pressure than before compresses my cock inside Yandere Chan's pussy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_48@Y-yandere Chan... I'm also... going to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_49@Senpai! Shoot it inside me... it's ok...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_5@Ugh... I... Yandere Chan...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_50@My mind goes blank... as the sudden pressure squeezes every drop of cum from my cock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_51@Ahh... Aha... Senpai's... steaming cum is pumping deep into my body... I'm... I'm so happy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_52@As long as I'm by Senpai's side... I feel like a normal girl... \nBut whenever Senpai looks at other women... I don't know why my body suddenly burns up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_53@Senpai... I... if my body starts burning up in the future and suddenly starts yearning for you, can I come seek you out...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_54@Looking at Yandere Chan's eyes misted with tears, her skin flushed red after orgasm, and her cute panting, I can't help but marvel at how attractive she is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_55@Of course... Whenever you want...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_56@I promise Yandere Chan, throwing caution to the wind... I guess I'll be spending more time naked than clothed in the future... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_57@You got this... My cock and balls, stay strong. The safety of all the girls in this area rest on your head...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_6@Hehe~ Senpai... you're finally awake? \nI feel a burning in my body again today ... and I can't stop shaking...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_7@I don't know what's gotten over me lately... but whenever I think about Senpai... my body starts burning... and there's an aching in my lower body... All I can think about is Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_8@I think that the chances of me being stripped naked recently have increased significantly...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_h2_9@You may be wondering how I got myself in this mess... Well, it all began a couple of days ago...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_13@Hm? My door is open?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_14@Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_15@Y-Yandere Chan?! How could you be here squatting by my bed? You freaked me out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_18@It's not like you can't be here, but you should think about the time and place...\nYandere Chan, don't you want to sleep?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_19@Sleeping is nothing at all compared to Senpai. The only thing I want to do is looking at Senpai.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_20@... Okay. But your feet will get numb if you keep squatting like that. Come and sit on my bed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_21@Senpai... is inviting me onto your bed...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_22@No, I mean──\nAnyway, just get up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_23@I get out from my duvet and sit with Yandere Chan by the bed, while Yandere Chan keeps staring at me with her eyes brimming with love all the time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_24@The similar guiltiness suddenly occupies my mind, but this time, I'm also feeling something different and special.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_25@(Now that I look at her closer, Yandere Chan has really grown up.\nShe's such a beautiful girl, but I have been the only person in her heart...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_26@I flick her bang aside. Surprisingly, Yandere Chan closes her eyes in enjoyment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_27@Seeing her adorable look, I can't help leaving a kiss on her forehead.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_28@Senpai... Ahh, Senpai, Senpai! You're mine! And I'm yours!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_29@Yandere Chan pounces at me in ecstasy and fixes my shoulders in order to kiss me, but I block her lips away with my natural reaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_30@Why did you refuse me? Is it because... Senpai doesn't want to be mine...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_31@Yandere Chan looks so hurt that I also feel a little painful. But then a bold idea comes to my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_1_32@Yandere Chan, you know, a kiss on the forehead and a kiss on the lips have completely different meanings. Therefore, I want to make the kiss on the lips a reward.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_18@Oh~ What a noble cause... but why would you have me use such flirtatious suggestions...? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_21@As soon as Yandere Chan has murderous impulses, it is immediately converted into desire towards you... \nAs long as you can go on a date with her, Yandere Chan will forget about her urge to kill and return to being a normal girl...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_24@With Yandere Chan's soft tiny hand in my hand, I walk with her on the street famous for furniture.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_25@Senpai, what kind of window do you want us to have?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_26@What you like will be the best. I trust your taste.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_27@Then let's go with an airtight window that can exclude all the noise except Senpai's and my voice. And I should add an electric lattice, so that no bitch can sneak into our room of love...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_28@Well... an electric lattice will be too far...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_29@Don't Senpai agree? Sorry... I don't want Senpai to hate me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_30@Really now... I won't hate you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_31@I make a pinky promise with Yandere Chan and kiss her on her cheek when she gets closer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_32@When we go back, I'll "reward" you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_34@I've always known that... you're the only one I need.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_5@It's c-coming again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_6@Hm? Senpai? What are you talking about...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_7@Nothing. Are we going to the furniture store again today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_8@Yes. My heart can't stop fluttering just thinking about decorating a loving room with Senpai...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_2_9@Alright, alright. I'll go change. And you should be careful about your blood pressure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_1@Phew... The bed just feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_10@Is it just me or all the recipes you know contain the step to chop the meat...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_11@Is that so? I didn't notice it. The only thing I've noticed is that my mood becomes better whenever I finish cooking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_12@... I should not ask anything further.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_13@Grrrrr──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_14@Is Senpai so eager to try out my dish? I'm flattered. It will be finished soon...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_15@After I sit down, Yandere Chan sets up the table, covers my lap with a napkin, and serves her dish.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_16@Woah, the pork chop smells so good! And...\n... Um... Red bean rice?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_17@I was thinking about Senpai when I was cooking, so I added the red beans into the rice unconsciously... Senpai, do you hate it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_18@I don't. It's just...\nAnyway, nothing. Then I'll start eating~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_19@I take a bite of the fried pork chop. The soft and juicy meat covered with crispy flour tastes like heaven in my mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_2@After weeks of hell-like training, not only the members are exhausted, I'm also reaching my limitation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_20@It's delicious! Yandere Chan, why don't you eat together?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_21@I've just eaten before. And now, I just want to enjoy this moment fully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_22@The sunlight softly illuminates the dorm with no one else inside. Yandere Chan cups her face with her hands on the table and looks at me concentratedly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_23@Affected by the lovely atmosphere, I can't help reaching out my hand to pat on her head and gets a happy smile in reply.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_24@(Except for the extreme aspect of her, Yandere Chan is just a normal girl. Hope this kind of happy daily life can last forever...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_3@So, when it's finally the resting day, I still don't want to get out of bed even when it's already noon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_4@I'm a little bit hungry, but no one seems to be around... Maybe I'll have to feed myself some instant noodle...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_5@Hm? What's that smell? It smells so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_6@I follow the fragrance to the kitchen with one hand scratching on my stomach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_7@Senpai, you're finally up. What a sleepyhead. Lunch is almost done.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_8@Yandere Chan? Why are you still in the dorm?... No. I'm more curious about the other thing── So you know how to cook?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P013_N_3_9@To make myself the perfect bride for Senpai, I've done a lot of training on cooking.\nThe recipes I can cook are just updated recently with spaghetti Bolognese, Pad Krapow Moo, and Braised Minced Pork...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_1@A gust of wind suddenly kicks up pieces of trash in a dark and silent alley that people seldom frequent. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_10@For an unknown reason my body is once again hot and bothered with an increased heart rate. This in turn affects my performance in battle... It seems that the professor's experiment has failed yet again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_11@Perfectly time traveling is still out of reach... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_12@There is still one year until I can execute my first mission... Searching for alternative plans...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_13@It is recommended to carry out the second mission first... find and protect player... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_14@Yet, there is a one year disparity from the information provided by the professor. The target's coordinates have also been lost during the botched time travel...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_15@I guess there's no helping it. I will have to collect intel first in the city... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_17@So this is... fifty years ago in the past... It is still just as lively... No... According to the information provided by the professor, the population in the past might be even more than my present...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_18@We bring you a news report... of a bank robbery in Z City. The suspects have been apprehended and 300 thousand dollars of stolen cash has been recovered, but there is still a large discrepancy between the 12 million the bank claims to have been stolen... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_19@The news... One of the most effective methods of disseminating information 50 years ago... Although traditional, it is still quite a nice way of receiving information. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_2@In the middle of the whirlwind, black matter continus to build and expand. The surrounding air distorts as if scorched by intense heat... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_20@For the next piece of news, we will be introducing the Squirt Gun Competition that has rapidly risen in popularity over the past couple of years. The exciting competition that is pleasing to the eye has attracted many investors to create their own teams...  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_21@Squirt Gun teams... I remember that in the information professor provided, player was the coach of a Squirt Gun team... Could it be... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_22@Of the newly created teams, the team led by player is currently the most eye-catching...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_23@player... Just as I thought...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_24@Coach player, what are your thoughts of your team being ranked first in the newcomer popularity polls?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_25@Uh... Of course... I'm very flattered, but I hope that people's interest in us isn't just fleeting, and that they're willing to show us more concrete support by coming to watch our matches!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_26@Do you have anything else you wish to say to the viewers?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_27@Yes, seeing how we are a newly formed Squirt Gun team, we are still openly recruiting more girls interested in competing in this sport...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_28@If you are interested, feel free to sign up for tryouts!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_29@Sign up... for player's Squirt Gun team...? \nThis is indeed a possible method to get close to player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_3@This weird phenomenom continued until a black figure appears from within...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_30@Whew~ How many more people to go...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_31@Hehe~ After Coach's interview on television, the amount of people coming for tryouts has increased by quite a lot~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_32@That's right... It is indeed good news for our team, but for us team members in charge of the tryouts, our workload has increased substantially... Will we even have time for training later?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_33@Ok, next~ Will the next person please come in~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_34@Nadeshiko, you're still so energetic...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_35@Hi there, and your name is...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_36@My code name is... Nemesis 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_37@Nemesis... The Goddess of Vengeance...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_38@Yes... That is my code name... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_39@Then... I'll just call you Nemesis... Is that okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_40@As you wish...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_41@May I ask what your reason for applying to tryouts is...?

T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_42@To execute and complete my mission...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_43@Meaning... to participate in and win competitions for the team... right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_44@You possess a nice drive to win~ 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_45@Then... let me ask you. Do you have any special abilities that can be applied in the Squirt Gun competitions?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_46@Stealth, disguise, and hand-to-hand combat techniques for assassination... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_47@What... what a special set of skills to have...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_48@(Nadeshiko... What do we do?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_49@Ok, I see. You possess quite a forte of practical skills. You can proceed to the next stage of the tryouts~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_5@Time... Confirmed... 290 AS... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_50@(Nadeshiko... Are you sure this is alright?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_51@(Don't worry, our team might just be missing someone like her!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_52@Sigh... Ok, next up is an interview with Coach. Please wait a moment... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_53@Hm? Is it my turn? There weren't many people able to advance to the second stage today~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_54@You have us to thank for weeding out those unfit for our team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_55@Coach~ this is Nemesis. She possesses superb athletic abilities and great stats overall~  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_56@Oh? Is that so? Ok then... Nemesis, what sports have you played before?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_57@Ah... player... Coach... My dear Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_58@Co-Coach...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_59@W-why did I say Coach...? Is something wrong with my vocal functions?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_6@Location... Confirmed... Star City... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_60@What is this feeling... My body... is burning up... Could there be something wrong with my body too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_61@Well... you're indeed younger than I am, but to call me your Coach so suddenly...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_62@I'm still quite happy! If calling me Coach will make you more relaxed, then feel free to call me that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_63@R-really...? Coach is so considerate... Can you please... p-p-pat my head...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_64@Oh no... What am I saying?! Why... can't I seem to control the words coming out of my mouth...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_65@Ah... Professor... It's the database she left inside my body, forcing me to say words against my will... This must be what the professor wanted to say to player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_66@This kid... will it really be alright? She's completely different from when we interviewed her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_67@Heheh~ Maybe she just really likes our Coach as well~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_68@A-alright... if you don't mind, I'll pat your head...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_69@Good girl, good girl~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_7@Error report... Confirmed... Estimated mission time, 291 AS... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_70@T-there's a current running through my body... I-it's too stimulating.. I-I can't hold on much longer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_71@Ah... the new girl... ran off...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_72@D-did I do something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_8@It seems like something went wrong with the time travel... We've already performed so many tests, but I'm still one year too early...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_1_9@Error report... Confirmed... Abnormal body readings... Irregularities in the sympathetic nervous system and hyperemia detected...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_1@Yui! You're slowing down! Are you too tired to keep running?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_10@Time to go~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_11@Sigh~~ Why is it me~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_12@I'm in position~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_13@What surprising results. By just substituting out one member, the whole team's movements has become even smoother. Their cooperation and trust is also flawless now. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_14@Akane, give it the final blow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_15@I got this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_16@Your aim is off, Akane!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_17@Ahhh~ I'm still too nervous... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_18@Be careful of the mock battle AI's counterattack! Don't space out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_19@Ahhh—!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_2@N-no! I can still keep going!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_20@As the mock battle AI's attack is just about to hit Akane, Nemesis appears at the last second to take the brunt of the hit for Akane...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_21@N-Nemisis...? Thank you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_22@Are you alright? Akane... senpai?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_23@I-I'm fine...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_24@Ok, that concludes today's training. I bet everyone is exhausted. \nRest up, we will have special physical fitness training in the afternoon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_25@Sob... I want to go home...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_26@Tomoka... you didn't even exert yourself... You're hopeless...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_27@Nemesis... Can you come to my office later? I want to discuss promoting you to a starter. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_28@Wow~ Nemesis~ Congratulations on becoming a starter. Now we can participate in competitions together in the future~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_3@As usual, all the girls are completely immersed in following Coach's orders during morning practice; that is, except for one person... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_30@Nemesis, ever since you became a starter, your performance hasn't been up to par. I know that you have it in you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_31@Sometimes... it even feels like you're holding back on purpose... \nWhy are you trying to hide your full potential?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_32@My dear Coach... Please forgive me. As for the reason... I can't say it just yet... Please believe me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_33@Forget it... I don't want to push you too hard... \nAnyways, starting from tomorrow you can skip basic training and train with the starting team. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_34@One more thing, you don't have to take it upon yourself to do all the menial chores. You can leave some of the work for the other newcomers. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_35@P-please allow me to refuse... My dear Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_36@Alright... then, about the afternoons training... \nUh... did you just say... you refuse?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_37@Yes... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_38@Is there some reason for that? Are you unsure if you want to become a starter yet...? Or could it be that you actually like doing chores...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_39@Professor... I can't keep up the facade any longer... I'm sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_4@Tomoka! Wake up already! \nYou're almost completely soaked already. If it was a real battle, you'd have been eliminated a long time ago!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_40@Coach, I'm actually... not from this time... I come from 50 years in the future...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_41@50 years? \nUm... is there some kind of... misunderstanding...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_42@M-misunderstanding...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_43@Never did I think that someone would lie to get out of becoming a starting member... and such an unbelievable lie to boot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_44@Did I really give you too much pressure...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_45@No... it's not like that... Coach is always correct! There's no way you would be wrong!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_46@If I'm always correct... then why did you lie to me... You are contradicting yourself right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_47@I... sigh~ Everything I say is the truth... \nI guess I don't have a choice... What I say next is only for your ears...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_48@I am not a real human. I am just an artificial lifeform sent back in time to carry out my missions... I have three missions entrusted to me, and my dear Coach, you are my first mission...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_49@I must ensure Coach's safety...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_5@W-what's going on...?! \nOh... I'm still in battle...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_50@Artificial lifeform? Three missions? My personal safety? I can't keep up... \nWhat's this about being an artificial lifeform? And who is out to kill me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_51@Only a body made from biomimicry technology can safely pass through a time portal and return to the past... but my bodily functions aren't any different from that of a normal human. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_52@As for who wants your life... I can't say yet, because that person... hasn't appeared yet... \nI am still one year too early... from the projected mission time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_53@Due to the above mentioned reasons, I must stay by your side and protect you. \nSo if possible, I would prefer to not be in the spotlight...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_54@Even if you say that... I can only suggest you to seek help... I know a good psychiatrist that I can recommend to you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_55@Enough! Coach... my dear Coach... If you still don't believe me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_56@W-what are you going to do...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_57@I can only prove it to you... Follow me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_58@This is... the train station? Why did you ask me to follow you here... do you have something you want to show me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_59@There is a girl... not too far from here... in the park. She is holding a weird pink bunny plush...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_6@Sigh... really now... \nNemesis, you're up next!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_60@The park? A girl? Holding a weird plush...? What's next?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_61@She has been searching for the person that gave her the doll many years ago at a summer camp... That person is you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_62@She will become a irreplacable member of the team and show great combat potential... \nHer name is... Saki...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_63@R-really? I don't think randomly chatting up strangers and asking them to join the team is a good idea... \nIf things go wrong and she calls the cops on me... you'll have to come bail me out of jail...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_64@Please... Coach... just trust me this once. She is a very important person to you. Although I can't change the future at will, this is the absolute truth...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_65@Are you sure...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_68@Hey... there! What are you doing here alone, little girl?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_7@Yes... my dear Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_72@S-saki...? Nemesis... was telling the truth?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_8@Attention! We will start practicing formation transformation now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_2_9@Akane, keep it up. Tomoka, get over here! Nemesis, you take Tomoka's position! Yui, remember to cover Nemesis!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_1@......~♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_10@Mhmm~ That's more like it~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_11@You guys look quite close~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_13@Ah... Hehehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_14@You two... not only are you close and have excellent cooperation, but your personalities are also similar... What is going on here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_15@If Coach says that, I'll be embarassed... \nNemisis is much more agile than me. I'm still so clumsy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_16@T-there's nothing of the sort... Miss... Saki... \nS-saki is much smarter, more gentle, and a lot more caring...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_17@Ok, ok, if this goes on much longer you two should just get married. \nDon't forget that we still have physical fitness training this afternoon. Next month we'll be participating in the finals!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_18@Yes, my dear Coach. Let me go back to my room to get ready and we can start the afternoon training. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_19@Ok, Nemesis... can you stay later? I have something I would like to discuss with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_2@Good afternoon Miss Saki, you seem to be in a good mood today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_20@Yes... my dear Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_21@My dear Coach, don't pick on Nemesis! She's a good friend of mine!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_22@Alright, if Saki says so how could I say no. Don't worry~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_23@It seems my efforts with Nemesis for the past couple of days seemed to have had a positive effect... Saki hums happily while skipping away...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_24@Coach... Miss Saki seems to be very happy. That's great. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_25@Yeah, thanks to your intel from the future, I was able to win enough money in a short period of time and afford to gift an expensive kimono to Saki~ 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_26@I used the excuse of doubting whether Nemesis was really from the future to ask her to prove herself by providing the latest lottery numbers and Squirt Gun scores...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_27@She kept her lips tightly sealed in the beginning, saying that it was illegal to use future information to profit and that the professor explicitly prohibited such actions. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_28@But after telling Nemesis that all this was so that I could trust her completely to assist her in completing her mission, and gifting Saki a present is just an additional benefit... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_29@Who knew that she actually agreed after a brief hesitation. You're so easily convinved... Such a naive child~!  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_3@Heh~ Coach gave me a present~ \nIt's a beautiful kimono~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_30@Coach also finally believed that I come from the future... I should be able to complete my mission much easier now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_31@Then... Nemesis~ Can we discuss tomorrow's Squirt Gun scores? That way I know where to place my bets...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_32@My dear Coach, that isn't allowed!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_33@Ugh... But... weren't you willing to tell me before...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_34@That was to gain your trust, and... in the history records the professor gave me, Coach did indeed buy her a kimono as a present...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_35@Wait... You said that in the professor's records I bought her a kimono... \nDoes that mean the professor is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_36@Ah... I... Please forget what you just heard!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_37@You've finally let slip the identity of this professor I keep hearing you talking about. Who would have thought that it would be Saki... No wonder the two of you seem so close. It all makes sense if she's your creator...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_38@Yes... my consciousness, personality, feelings, and memories all originate from her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_39@So it's like I have two little sisters now. I really didn't peg Saki to be the genius type... and she actually knows my preferences... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_4@That's wonderful... Miss Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_40@My dear Coach... did you say something about preferences...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_41@N-nothing... I didn't say anything...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_42@I almost let slip my kink... It seems that in the future I will still share it with Saki...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_43@She also only gets aroused by me... Hehehe, good work Saki!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_44@Coach... Your smile... is a little perverted...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_45@Ahh! My bad, so sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_46@If that's all, I'll go prepare water, snacks, and towels for everyone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_47@Are you really unwilling to become a starting player? It's such a waste not to put your strengthened attributes to good use. Don't you want a stage where you can shine?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_48@As I said before, my abilities are used to complete my missions. The first of which is to protect you, and the second...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_49@Hmm? This is the first time hearing Nemesis talking more about her second mission...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_5@My dear Coach invited me to go to the firework festival together... Oh my god, I'm getting nervous just thinking about it. I must dress up properly!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_50@The second mission is to kill the woman that will kill you in the future...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_51@W-woman? So that eliminates the league chairman and Riria's father in the military... \nWho could it be...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_52@I-I can't say yet, if I tell you now... you might become an obstacle in my path to completing my mission.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_53@An obstacle? That's impossible. \nWhy would I protect someone that's trying to kill me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_54@Coach! Where are you? We need your help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_55@There you are! I've been waiting for ages! \nHow could you just leave me all alone?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_56@Sorry, Akane. I'll be over shortly. \nThe physical fitness training this afternoon is at the nearby gym, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_57@What gym? We have training with the new member today, and we're also going to be introducing her at the same time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_58@New member...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_59@Ohh, I remember now. We just met yesterday... Although there were some unexpected events...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_6@Miss Saki... maybe let me help you then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_60@Sigh... I'll entrust that kid to you, be sure to properly take care of her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_61@Could it be...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_66@The target... has appeared...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_67@Commence operations for the second mission... termination of the target!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_7@Sure, if it's not too much of a hassle. \nThere is one thing that has been bothering me though...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_8@How many times have I told you to stop calling me "Miss Saki"... \nYou're my senior, so you can just call me by my name.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_3_9@Ok... I'll do my best... S... Saki...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_1@Pant... Pant... Pant... Damn it... Who is this girl...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_11@Kana swung an ax with all her might in Yandere Chan's direction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_13@Yandere Chan just barely dodges the swing, and escapes from the park under the cover of the dust cloud kicked up from the blow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_14@I let her escape again... A heavy weapon can deal a lethal blow, but at the same time, it also has a slow swing speed and lower accuracy... Next time, I should consider alternative methods...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_15@There's no way that is Kana... Damn it... Who is that imposter... \nAnd how does she know my position... Could she be tracking me through my aura...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_16@Each time she takes on the appearance of a different girl... This time it was Kana, but who will it be next time...  \nDamn this girl...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_17@I heard that... So this is where you were hiding~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_18@—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_19@Saki silently appears behind Yandere Chan and deftly wraps the rope in her hands around Yandere Chan's neck, tightly constricting her breathing.   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_2@Even though it is daytime, there is nobody to hear the sound of Yandere Chan's labored breathing in the empty park. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_20@Gah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_21@Shh~ only sweet dreams from here! \nYou have brought us so much pain already, so why don't you just cooperate for once and stop being so troublesome...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_23@Yandere Chan's face is bright red and she flails her arms around, struggling painfully. \nBehind her, Saki skillfully dodges all of Yandere Chan's attacks. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_24@Just before passing out, Yandere Chan fumbles for the knife that she carries on herself and cuts the rope wrapped around her neck...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_25@Pant~ Hah... Who... are... you...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_26@Saki glares coldly at Yandere Chan and prepares to attack her once again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_27@No matter who you are... or who you can turn into... I'll just have to treat you as an obstacle between Senpai and me... Isn't that right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_28@Through self-hypnosis, Yandere Chan convinces herself that the person in front of her is an obstacle between Senpai and herself. In an instant, Yandere Chan's body produces a large amount of adrenaline and she gains a sudden surge in power...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_29@She disappeared...? What astonishing speed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_3@I didn't detect her presence at all, and she could approach me so easily... I've never met someone like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_30@I refuse to... be a sitting duck! \nThis time, it's my turn to go on the offensive!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_31@Yandere Chan moves at an incredible speed and instantly appears behind Saki for a sneak attack.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_32@Die! You meddlesome woman!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_33@Heh... Did you think that such feeble struggles would be of any use? \nHow cute...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_34@Saki seems to be able to see right through Yandere Chan's attacks. \nShe preemptively catches Yandere Chan's ax in midair.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_35@Ugh... I can't break free... Just how strong is this woman?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_36@Struggling is futile. All of your body's data and attack patterns are stored inside my memory. \nI am the one that knows you the best in this world...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_37@Then how about this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_39@As Yandere Chan and Saki fight over control of the ax, Yandere Chan suddenly shoots out a razor blade hidden in her mouth!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_4@Yandere Chan crouches behind a building with a nervous look on her face, as if hiding from someone. She is a stark contrast to the serene surroundings of the park... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_40@There is a long gash on Saki's face from where the razor blade had sliced her skin, but there was no sign of blood. Instead, a different colored layer of skin is revealed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_41@You... bitch!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_43@I was originally thinking of how not to make a mess... \nIt seems that my worries were for naught, and allowed you to find an opening...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_44@As Saki is talking to herself, at the same time she also rips the gash on her face even wider, revealing the real face hidden underneath the "Saki" mask...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_45@Did you faint from that blow? \nThen why don't you... go die! Yandere Chan!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_46@S-stop! Nemesis!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_48@S-saki...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_49@I've heard everything from Coach... I will create you 50 years from now... \n In order to protect my dear Coach and kill Yandere Chan...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_5@Inside the quiet park, apart from the sound of Yandere Chan's panting, the sound of footsteps suddenly appears...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_50@Professor... If you already knew everything, why are you stopping me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_51@That's... that's... becuase I don't like this situation... \nWe are all companions fighting alongside each other on Coach's team... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_52@Why do we have to hurt each other like this?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_53@Professor... You don't understand... In the near future, Yandere Chan becomes hard to control and eventually she ends up killing Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_54@That's why you created me and transferred all of your memories of Yandere Chan and your hate towards her to me. It was so that I can come to the past and stop this tragedy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_55@No... No matter what happens, the me right now just can't turn a blind eye! \nI can't accept teammates killing each other...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_56@Sniff, sniff...Sob... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_57@Professor... Don't be like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_58@Saki... Stop your crying. I've told you before that there is no way I will let this happen...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_59@My dear Coach...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_6@Footsteps...? Who is it?! \nCould it be that woman?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_60@Nemesis... the future has been altered already...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_61@What... did you say?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_62@Last time, after you told me about your missions, I went back and thought long and hard... \nIn your time period, did I know that I will die in Yandere Chan's hands?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_63@No... You didn't know... In professor Saki's memories, after meeting Yandere Chan, you discovered that her sickness only got worse as time passed on...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_64@You decide to try an extreme method to provoke Yandere Chan so that she would hopefully leave the team... The plan backfired...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_65@You and Akane... were killed by the rampaging Yandere Chan... As a result, the team disbanded... and everyone left heartbroken...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_66@Yet, now I know... right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_67@... You mean...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_68@When I saw your piercing gaze the first time you saw Yandere Chan, I had a hunch of what your true target was...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_69@That's why I have already put plans in place to prevent my death!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_70@Is the... future really changed already...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_71@Trust me... As long as you are here, the future will definitely be changed... Nemesis.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_72@player holds on tightly to Nemesis' hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_73@Ahh~ My body... is convulsing uncontrollably... It's like there is an electrical current coursing through me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_74@What's wrong? Nemesis...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_75@I-I'm fine... S-saki...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_76@Nemesis... Your face is so red... Are you really alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_8@Kana...? What is she doing here? \nShe doesn't usually pass through here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_4_9@Oh? This aura... \nYandere Chan? So this is where you are hiding~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_1@After Saki joined the team, she really did quickly became an indispensable part of the team. That's not even considering the double-barrelled turbo gun she invented, which could compress water into powerful streams.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_10@No... Ah... Stop... Nghh... Not there...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_11@This is Nemesis' room... could she be in trouble?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_12@Nemesis, are you alright?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_13@The scene in front of my eyes is completely different than what I imagined in my head. Nemesis, who was usually so cold and serious, has removed her skirt and lay on her bed touching herself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_14@S-sorry! I-I didn't mean to barge in... I... I'll just leave now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_15@My... dear Coach... Please don't go... Let me take a good look at you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_17@I was expecting Nemesis to scream and chase me out, but her unexpected words leaves me totally dumbfounded... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_18@Coach... Ahh~ It feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_19@I can't bear to break my eyes away from the scene in front of me. The tears welling up in Nemesis' eyes as she stares seductively at me only adds to the difficulty. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_2@Saki can even modify her plush doll into an autonomous attacking robot... In certain aspects... Saki can definitely be considered a genius...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_20@Look at me... my dear Coach... I just want you to... properly look at me... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_21@As soon as I opened the door, my eyes were already tightly glued to Nemesis' smooth and supple skin. As my eyes wandered downwards, Nemesis' skin becomes flushed in both embarassment and excitement.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_22@My body... when passing through the time portal, encountered an abnormality...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_23@Now, everytime during a full moon, my body feels as if it's on fire... I can't read any information stored in my mind... and thoughts of Coach fill my head...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_24@Professor... built a database containing all of Coach's information inside me... and during this time, only Coach's videos and pictures are able to be read...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_25@Professor... Is she your creator? Who is she...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_26@Now that my dear Coach is here in front of me personally... My body is burning even hotter... My fingers... they can't stop... touching myself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_27@Oh no... None of my words are getting across to Nemesis right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_28@My body... My hands... have no intention of stopping... My dear Coach... I can't control myself... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_29@As Nemesis talks, her body starts convulsing violently ... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_3@So... what Nemesis has been saying might all be true... \nShe is an artificial lifeform created and sent from the future...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_30@Nemesis' hurried moaning and quivering body is too much for me to handle and my body starts reacting to the stimulus...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_31@My mind is being completely overrun by Coach... I-I'm so scared...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_32@My dear Coach~ Let me touch you, quickly... I want to feel your warmth...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_33@Oh boy... I can't resist taking off my pants after hearing Nemesis' words. My majestic cock springs to attention in front of Nemesis...  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_34@This is... my dear Coach's... There's no record of this in professor's database... \nAhh~ I-It feels like... my conscious... is f-fading away...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_35@I stroke my eager cock in time to Nemesis's moans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_36@As Nemesis' moans pick up in speed, a lewd smell permeates the air from the love juices. I also am close to letting my lust burst free... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_37@My dear Coach... I... I can't hold out much longer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_39@In an instant, my mind blanks out as I feel my lower body pulsing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_4@This is just too sci-fi... \nBut... there's someone that wants to kill me in the near future...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_41@As Nemesis convulses from her climax, I spray my thick cum all over her body. White cum and sweat mix together on Nemesis' flushed skin.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_42@My dear... dear Coach... I'm sorry... \nI let you see this side of me... Will you hate me for this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_43@I had never seen Nemesis like this before... She's just like a child seeking love and warmth, and she looks at me with puppy dog eyes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_44@Of course not... You've shown me such a cute side of yourself. How could I bring myself to hate you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_45@I caress Nemesis's body as I comfort her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_46@Thank you... my dear Coach... If you were to hate me... I wouldn't be able to complete my mission...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_47@Your mission... Who would create a lifeform and send her back in time to protect me at all costs...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_5@Could it be Nadeshiko's father? Or maybe even Riria's father...? \nDang it, now I get paranoid whenever I see someone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_6@Nghh... Ah... Ah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_7@A weird sound is coming from a room up ahead...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_8@Everyone should be resting at this hour... Is something wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h1_9@I trace the sound down the corridor to its origin. The door is slightly ajar, and soft moans along with the light inside the room leak out...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_1@Coach... Do you have time tonight? \nI want to... discuss something with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_10@N-Nemesis... What's going on...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_11@Do you hate seeing me like this? My dear Coach...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_12@N-no that's not it. It's just that I wasn't prepared... to see you wearing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_13@I didn't get to finish my sentence before Nemesis lunges at me and skilfully removes my clothes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_14@N-Nemisis... What...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_15@My dear Coach... Didn't I tell you that I came back for three missions... Do you remember?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_16@T-three missions...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_17@This isn't good... I can't think clearly with a naked girl on top of me. I am left with only one functional body part...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_18@Ahh... My dear... dear Co-Coach... \nY-you're so... hard...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_19@My cock is tightly pressed against the entrance of Nemesis' pussy \nEverytime my cock pulses, I can feel Nemesis squirm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_2@Nemesis looks at me bashfully. I don't know what she has in mind, but I can't turn down a girl when she wants to discuss personal matters...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_20@I can't complete my first and second mission right now. So, all I can do is... the third mission... to bear your child in lieu of professor Saki...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_21@My child... with Saki...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_22@That's right... In the future, you are killed by Yandere Chan before professor Saki had a chance to bear your child... That's why I was created using the professor's genes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_23@This is... my most important mission...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_24@My body is on fire... My dear Coach... Please... Hug me tightly...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_25@I can't bear to resist after hearing Nemesis beg me like this... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_26@Commence operations for the third mission... \nMy dear Coach... is finally... inside me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_27@As soon as I put my cock into Nemesis' moist pussy, I can feel the folds of her pussy wall contracting and sucking on my cock. \nThe complicated folds within her pussy constantly assault me with an extreme stimulus...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_28@Mission... commencing... Ahh~ \nMy body... It's as if being electrocuted... Why... is my body... going to break?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_29@As I see Nemesis' serious face trying to execute her mission, I can't resist teasing her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_3@Not to mention that I also want to discuss Yandere Chan's issue with her... I really hope that the two can get along in the future... Or else it's going to be a problem for all the members on the team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_30@Who would have thought that Nemesis would be so lewd... Did Saki program you to be this horny and grant you the capablities to pleasure men?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_31@I'm not... lewd... I'm not...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_32@Nemesis is quick to deny my allegations, but she doesn't stop moving her hips in pleasure...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_33@If you weren't made for my pleasure... then explain why your body is so attractive, and even your insides are so finely detailed?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_34@I... Ahh~ I... don't know...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_35@Look at your lower mouth, sucking on my cock so greedily. Everytime I thrust into you, it feels like my cock is going to be crushed. What exactly did Saki teach you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_36@No... It's not like that... Professor Saki... \nShe didn't... tell me that Coach's cock would be so...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_37@If you don't like it... I can stop anytime you want...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_38@No! Don't stop! \nDon't stop! You can't stop!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_39@Oh? You don't want me to stop... Could it be because...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_40@I don't know... I'm just... Ahh~ \nElectricity keeps coursing through my body... I'm about to... I'm about to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_41@My dear Coach... Stop... Stop teasing me... I'm about to lose my mind...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_42@Say you're a sluttly little girl~ \nIf you say so, I'll reward you and show you even greater pleasure...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_43@I'm... I'm a slutty... little girl... \nI crave Coach's cock...! I need my dear Coach's cock!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_44@Please... My dear Coach... give it to me... \nStop... teasing me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_45@I can't help but smile. In the end, Nemesis still lost to her bodily desires...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_46@Fine... In order to reward your honesty, I'll pick up my speed then!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_47@I take in a deep breath, and start increasing the speed of my thrusts as my cock reaches maximum hardness!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_48@Coach... You're... so thick... Such a hard cock... Ahhh... Too much data... my database... is going to overflow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_49@Ah... Ahhhh~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_50@Nemesis's body suddenly arches and her pussy tightly constricts against my cock. The pressure is urging my cock to spew its white liquid all inside of her body.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_51@I'm... I'm cumming...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_52@There is no response from Nemesis. It seems that she has lost consciousness... \nI pump her pussy full of my white hot cum...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_54@Coach... my dear Coach... W-where am I...? \nI... shut off...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_55@Yes, when I cummed inside you... I couldn't wake you up no matter how hard I tried~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_56@This experience... is my first...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_57@It doesn't have to be your only time... As long as you stay by my side...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_58@I definitely will... Even if I have completed my mission... I will continue to stay here. \nAfter all, in the future... my dear Coach doesn't exist...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_59@Nemesis holds my hand tightly and closes her eyes while cuddling against me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_6@Coach... I'm coming in...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_7@Nemesis... I want to talk with you about...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_8@My words are stuck in my mouth as I see the scene in front of me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_h2_9@Nemesis enters my room and stands in front of me completely naked... \nDid she walk all the way to my room naked?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_10@So-Sorry! I just want to be next to my dear Coach so badly...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_12@Even though Nemesis usually acts differently when she's in front of me, I've never seen her acting so needy. So I observe Nemesis carefully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_13@Are you okay? Do you feel ill?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_14@I don't── Ugh! Maybe I'm feeling a little ill... But if Coach can pat me on my head, it should be cured immediately!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_15@Nemesis raises her head and looks at me with her eyes sparkling beneath the moonlight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_16@(How should I put it... She's just like a puppy now. That's so adorable.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_17@Just when I get tempted by the cute look and ready to place my head on Nemesis's head, a cloud floats over and covers the moonlight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_19@After Nemesis's eyes turn back to the normal clear status, she walks back for two steps right away with her face as red as a tomato.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_20@Sorry, my dear Coach! I, I didn't mean to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_21@You're back to the usual Nemesis.\nSo what's going on?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_22@... I'm afraid that's because of the failure on the data delivery.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_23@Data delivery?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_24@This time spot is one year earlier than when Doctor wants me to go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_25@Maybe that's why I lose control of my body whenever there's the full moon. I can only struggle to regain my rationality somewhere I can't see the moonlight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_26@Ha... That sounds so tough.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_27@I'll try my best to control myself. Please allow me to take my leave first today... Good night, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_28@And Nemesis runs back to her room, leaving my hand raised in the air.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_29@I don't mind so much though, since it's very cute.\nBut why do I feel... I've seen that mode somewhere else?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_6@Just when I'm murmuring, my clothes are pulled by someone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_7@Waaaahh! It's coming!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_8@Wha-What's coming?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_1_9@Nemesis? It's you... Don't suddenly grip my clothes like that. You almost scared me to death.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_10@Wait, wait. Hold on. What did you say you were picking?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_11@Nemesis's face turns even redder. She takes a deep breath and suddenly hands over the catalog to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_12@My dear Coach, this is my third mission... Please marry me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_13@I said hold on!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_14@After a long story of explanation, I finally understand the reason.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_15@Saki sent you back to "be together with me" because the future me was killed?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_16@Yes, and according to the data Doctor input, the final status of "be together with you" means marriage. That's why I chose this wedding dress store out of hundreds.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_17@... I know you're goal-oriented, but I didn't know you're so extreme.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_18@I massage my forehead to ease the headache with my fingers and raise my head with determination.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_19@Listen. Maybe we will get married afterwards, but it's not now── Nemesis, you're skipping too many things!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_20@I, I am?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_21@You said yourself that marriage is the final status... That means there are still a lot of steps before marriage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_22@I say while holding Nemesis's hands in mine. The heavy catalog drop from her hands to the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_23@Joining competitions together, eating together, and going on a date together...\nIt's not too late to talk about marriage after doing so many things "together."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_24@Furthermore, don't you think it's a pity to skip all the steps before that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_25@Coach, do you mean...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_26@Nemesis, I want to be together with you.\nBefore being my wife, are you willing to be my girlfriend first?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_27@Even though there isn't a full moon, Nemesis's eyes still get sparkling.\nShe holds my hands tightly and nods.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_28@I love my dear Coach the most!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_6@Nemesis, there you ar...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_8@What's that book in your arms? Why is it bigger than my pillow?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_2_9@It's a catalog of wedding dresses. I still have two in my room. If we can't pick any from this book, I'll go get another catalog from my room...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_1@Yesterday when Saki and Nemesis hung out together, a potted plant fell from the second floor...\nAnd Nemesis was heavily smashed by it in order to protect Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_10@Or...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_11@Freshly baked fortune cookies~ Come test your fortune! The greatest prize is──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_12@... Large teddy bear?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_13@How did you know?... What?! Wow! Guys! There's already someone that got the biggest prize!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_14@Nemesis is so lucky! You just got the prize with a random pick.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_16@Nemesis looks a little strange, so I, who is here to help to carry bags, quietly get closer to Nemesis when Saki is not noticing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_17@Hey, did you... use the advantage of being someone "from the future"?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_18@I didn't──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_19@Nemesis denies it right away, but soon bites her lip with a confused expression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_2@Even though I've confirmed that there was no wound and allowed her to act freely, something weird still happens today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_20@I didn't take the initiative to use it, but as long as I thought that Miss Saki will be happy for those, my body moved unconsciously...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_21@Could it be the sequela after getting smashed by the plant? Like some kind of temporary error in the code?\nBut... if that's what it is, you don't have to mind it so much. After all, you didn't mean it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_22@What's more, Saki looks very happy. How about just make today a lucky day?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_23@Seeing how Saki smiles with the teddy bear in her arms, Nemesis also blooms a slight smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_24@... That would be nice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_3@Nemesis, let's go to the counter, shall we?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_4@I want to go to another counter... Is that okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_6@Congratulations! You're the 100th customer today! This pack is for you! Be sure to come here often!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_7@Wow! It's a lucky cat mascot! That's so cute.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_8@Please take it if you like it, Mis... Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P014_N_3_9@Really? Thank you, Nemesis.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_1@On an island somewhere in the southern part of Valkyria...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_10@Rude intruder...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_11@After the Mighty Dragon was awoken from its slumber. It enveloped everything as far as the eye can see within a massive blackhole \nwhich instantly swallowed Monica.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_13@Yawn... To wake up for a morning jog even when sleep deprived, I'm such a diligent person...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_14@Seriously... the team's victory celebration party last night went way overboard... \nWhy on earth would the girls want me to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_15@These girls are way too daring... don't they know that playing games like that when drunk could lead to some real dangerous situations?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_16@Never mind. I shouldn't take them too seriously. Instead, I should focus on the upcoming tough battle next week.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_17@Speaking of which... our opponent is a team that spent a lot of time practicing their movement... \nWill we be able to deal with it...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_18@However, it's too late to train my girls to be able to move as fast as the enemy team now... \nWhat we need is someone that can immobilize them...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_19@For instance, a magician that can turn the ground into a sea of flames with a snap of her fingers...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_2@Rumor has it that this island is inhabited by an ancient Mighty Dragon of the sea. \nAnyone who wins its recognition will be granted a mysterious relic that can make any wish come true...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_20@What am I even saying... Really now... I should just focus on jogging...\nWoooahh──！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_21@What the heck... Why did I just trip... Did I kick something...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_22@Uuhm... Uuugh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_23@A w-woman...? Why is she fainted here on the beach...?\nCould it be... that she drowned in the sea and was washed back to shore?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_25@Well, it looks like she's still breathing. All right... I, player, am here to perform resuscitation...\nFirst, aim for her lips... Second, prepare myself to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_27@It-it actually worked! A mere kiss on the... I mean...\nI'm glad I only had to blow once for you to wake up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_28@You... little...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_29@Terrific. Were it not for my morning jogging routine, no one would have been here to save you in time...\nYou really don't have to thank me. Well, maybe just your contact information...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_3@The humiltion of having my kingdom destroyed... is still fresh in my mind...\nIf there really is some way to make my wish come true, I won't let go of this opportunity...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_30@You insolent jerk! How dare you lay your filthy hands on the queen of Goz, Monica...\ncurrent leader of the Scarlet Rebels!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_31@So... so your name is Monica... Wha-what a great name!\nBut what was that about Goz... and the Scarlet rebels or what not... Are you still dreaming?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_32@I see that you are just asking to be punished!\nRed Lotus!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_33@Fi-fire!! Help~! I'm on fire! Ahhhhhh~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_34@That's weird... why is my flame... so weak...?\nIt should have burnt this man to a crisp...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_35@Stop thinking about why your flame is so small for a second! Just help me put out the fire! Ahhhhh~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_4@Mighty Dragon of the sea, I'm Monica, queen of the Goz kingdom!\nI'm here because I require the mysterious relic that fulfills wishes. Come now! I wish to partake in your trial!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_5@Thou... the time for the trial is not yet upon us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_6@I know I did indeed come earlier than I should have, but so what?\nAs a queen, I am duty bound to restore my kingdom. Therefore, the sooner I pass the trial, the better!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_8@If you are unwilling to conduct the trial... Then I guess I will have to conduct it by force!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_1_9@Monica extended one arm, gathering large amounts of fire element in her palm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_1@Am I really in... another world...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_10@Yes, master. I'm now opening your voice memo...\nPlease say what you would like me to record...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_11@What... is this?! Did a voice just suddenly come out from this mirror that is smaller than a piece of paper...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_12@This is a smartphone... Oh that's right, you don't have this kind of thing in your world, right?\nThis gadget can be used to make phone calls, look up information, play games, take photos, listen to music, and watch movies...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_13@W-w-wait a minute... you sprouted a ton of weird things from your mouth...\nbut I can't remember everything you just said...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_14@Hehe... what a hillbilly. Look carefully now! This is the magic in our world — technology!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_15@How... how dare you be so smug in front of a queen...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_16@Come now. Repeat all the titles you just said, but say it to my smartphone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_17@I... I am Monica, the Flameborn, the Flame Emperess, queen of the Goz kingdom, the Scarlet Priestess, and leader of the Scarlet Rebels...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_18@Okay. Monica, the Flameborn, the Flame Emperess, queen of the Goz kingdom, the Scarlet Priestess, and leader of the Scarlet Rebels...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_19@It's... it's really taking note...\nBut saying those things to a machine instead of someone feels pretty embarrassing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_2@Told ya. This is Star City, not somewhere called Valkyria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_20@You're in for a lot more surprises. Here, look at my smartphone~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_21@Look at... where?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_22@Hehe, now say cheese!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_23@How... how rude! You are not allowed to be this close to the queen! Don't you put your face so close to mine!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_24@Heehee~ We've got a nice photo here~\nLook how nervous you are. How adorable~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_25@S-such insolence! How dare you call me... ador-adorable...\nWait, what? My face is printed on it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_26@That's not all! Look, I can even make your skin glow! Now, let's add some special effects...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_27@Is... is this really me? Such smooth and bright skin...\nWhat did you call this thing again..? It is truly magical...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_28@It's a smartphone~ Hehe, do you want it?\nIf you join my squirt gun team, I'll buy you a smartphone! How does that sound?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_29@Well, well~ So you wish to use my invincible powers to secure victories?\nVery well. I'm not against lending my power in exchange for something I want!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_3@Speaking of powers... My flame has become significantly weaker here...\nThe concentration of elemental power here is indeed not as rich as that of Valkyria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_30@This is terrific! Everything is falling into place just when I need it!\nNow I have a plan to deal with next week's competition!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_31@What a deal! I gained an otherworldly flame manipulator for just the price of a smartphone. I can't wait to see the surprised looks on our opponent's faces when they see what Monica can do~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_32@This power called technology... Maybe it can help me restore my kingdom...\nAnyways, I'll take the offer from this guy first and find a way to get back to my world afterwards...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_33@Of course, during my stay here in this world, I should take the opportunity to search for more powers that can assist me in restoring my kingdom... and take them all back with me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_34@Heeheehee~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_4@By the way, how did you create fire out of thin air? Are you some kind of magician...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_5@Since you did save my life, I'll kindly remind you once again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_6@I am Monica, the Flameborn, the Flame Emperess, queen of the Goz kingdom, the Scarlet Priestess, and leader of the Scarlet Rebels... You'd better try to keep that in mind and conduct yourself properly in my presence...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_7@Hold on, hold on... You have too many titles for me to remember them all at once...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_8@How could you not even remember such simple titles... Are the people in this world all barbarians with no manners...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_2_9@Just one moment! I'll record it with my smartphone...\nRinko, open my voice memo for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_1@The tools required to maintain the squirt guns are broken again... Sigh, guess I'll have to go on a shopping trip myself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_10@Oh yeah, I've put the chips I didn't finish yesterday into a ziplock bag. Bring it to me as well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_11@Monica changed her posture from kneeling to sitting cross-legged on the sofa. She used one leg to point in the direction of the fridge, while never taking her eyes off of the tablet computer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_12@Can you at least look at the person you're ordering around...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_13@The speed at which you adapt to new environments is quite amazing. It has only been a few weeks but you've already completely assimilated to this world...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_14@I deftly opened Monica's bag of chips and delivered it in front of the mighty queen along with her drink so she could gorge herself on the snacks... I just hope that she won't be too inquisitive about where I will be going later...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_15@Alright, everything you want is here. You can enjoy being a couch potato like a modern, civilized person here. Now, I'm going to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_16@Wait... Where are you going?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_17@As Monica gripped the corner of my T-shirt tightly, I could see the curiosity and anticipation bursting from her eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_18@I... I'm going to a shop nearby to buy some tools, or...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_19@Or checking out the shopping street, right?! I just saw a nice dessert shop in the shopping street last time! You're bringing me there, aren't you?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_20@I... I'm just going out to grab the tools I need...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_22@I don't care what you're trying to buy! I just want to go out and see all the remarkable things in this world!\nYou have no idea how boring it is to be cooped up at home everyday!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_23@Uhh... Well, Miss Monica... You aren't being very convincing the way you're enjoying your snacks and drinks while reading comic books...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_25@Have you decided to stay at home after all...? Then I'll be going now. Be back in a bit...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_26@I'm going to report to the leauge that you have an illegal member on your team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_27@No way~~ Miss Monica... What did you just say? Did I hear you correctly?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_28@If you don't take me out for window shopping and dessert, I'll inform the squirt gun league that you hired an unknown person with no ID who possesses magical power from another world to be a stand-in team member in the next match...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_29@Where did you learn about the squirt gun league rules?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_30@I found the squirt gun league rules on the internet. Rules and limitations regarding the hiring of members for the squirt gun competitions are listed under article 3, section 8.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_31@How... did you even learn to use the internet in such a short amount of time... Dang it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_32@What did you just say, player?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_33@No... nothing... So, Miss Monica...\nAll I have to do is to take you out to go window shopping and to eat the dessert you want?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_34@Such insolence! Even in this world, I am still queen of the Goz kingdom. At least refer to me as "Your Highness!"\nAlso your head is raised way too high when talking to me... Hmm? Are you listening?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_35@Y-yes, Your Highness... Your servant will go make preperations for your departure right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_4@Insolent jerk! Wha-what are you looking at?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_5@Monica... It's been three hours and you're still lying on the couch watching videos on the tablet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_6@Th-that's not true! I've changed my posture!\nMost importantly, I'm reading comics now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_7@Monica, who was originally lying on her stomach, moved her ass back so that she was kneeling on her knees. However, her hands and the tablet never moved an inch...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_8@You're one to talk...\nYour posture right now reminds me of another member on the team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_3_9@Stop nagging me! You rude peasant! Your queen is thirsty. Go get me a drink from the fridge!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_1@Your Highness... Our queen, who once led us to numerous victories on the battlefield...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_11@Who is it...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_12@It's me, player. May I come in...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_13@Permission granted... Come in...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_14@I heard screaming, so I came to check in on you... Is there anything wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_15@Thank you for caring... I'm fine...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_16@Then... why does it look like you've been crying...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_17@I... I'm really okay... It's nothing worth mentioning...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_18@After meeting you on the beach and taking you back, I've finally realized that you're not from this world. I've seen you trying your best to adapt to life here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_19@The way you always tackle challenges head on has caught my eye. However, I still feel like there is a gulf between us... I... I want to get to know you better, Monica...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_2@You... It's you guys again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_20@Are you... trying to court the queen of a kingdom? player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_21@Well... I... I just want to... express my concern...\nHow should I put it... Since we have a mutually beneficial relationship~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_22@If you only care about our mutual benefits... then I don't you need to know too much about my past...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_23@You only want my power, and I only want your assistance to make my way in this world.\nOur relationship is nothing more, don't you agree?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_24@I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_25@Sigh... Forget it, I don't want another person to carry this heavy burden on my shoulders...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_26@Life here has been like a dream. The convenience of technology, abundant food and resources, and most importantly, peace... How I wish that I could also belong to this reality...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_27@Sadly, the world I was born and raised is a war-torn battlefield between the gods of light and darkness.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_28@My duty has already been engraved into my very soul...\nIt keeps reminding me not to forget what happened on the day that changed my fate completely...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_29@A dream... Can't this dream become your reality?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_3@You were once our belief... You were once our hope...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_30@player... Do you still not understand...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_31@No! I don't... You're standing in the flesh right in front of me, Monica. I can just reach out and touch you. Your existence is undeniable!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_32@I want to protect you and fulfill your dream... because I... I am attracted to you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_33@How great would it be if this reality was all just a dream... Of course I've considered just letting go... After carrying this duty of mine on my shoulders for so long, I also grow weary...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_34@player... Tonight... just for tonight... can you fulfill this beautiful dream of mine?\nA dream that can make me forget everything... Tonight, I'm no longer queen of the Goz kingdom, but yours...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_35@My gorgeous queen... If it's ok, I hope that it won't just be for tonight...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_4@I'll do it... The tragedy is still fresh in my mind...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_5@Look at the you now... Did you forget your duty...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_6@Queen of the Goz kingdom!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_7@Ahhh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_8@... Was it all just a dream...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_4_9@I've sworn in front of everybody...\nto gain power to restore my kingdom... but what am I doing now...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_1@To satisfy Monica, I pull out the gate of the dorm and bring her out beneath the crystal moonlight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_10@I point at the heart-shaped sculpture right in front of us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_11@You in-insolent jerk! How could you check my search history without my consent...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_12@I'll admit the insolent part.\nBut seeing how I am fulfilling your wish, will you forgive me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_13@... Fine. You're the king tonight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_14@Monica, whose face is as red as a tomato, holds my hand reaching towards her.\nWith a slight pull, I embrace her in my arms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_15@This is the right pose. Here. Look at the camera on the smartphone──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_16@You're doing it again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_17@Alright~ This is a pretty good photo, isn't it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_18@On the screen, I'm holding Monica, whose face blushes with surprise, and the heart shape is right around us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_19@... It sucks. We look just like a stupid couple.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_2@player? What do you want to do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_20@Isn't it good to be just a stupid couple instead of the queen from another world?\nWhen you first came here, I remember taking a photo for you as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_22@Monica returns my smartphone to me and softly leaves my arms, bathing in the moonlight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_23@And she turns around, blooming a misty and gorgeous smile that I have never seen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_24@In my world, magic power comes from thick elements. I thought it was the sole theory in the world.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_25@I didn't expect this ordinary sculpture and photo can bring me such a different magic power...\nI've never been so satisfied. Thank you, player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_3@Monica looks at me with her head tilted.\nThis way she no longer looks haughty. Instead, it's pretty cute for her to do so.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_4@Just follow me and you'll know.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_6@We're at... Willowbank Park?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_7@Yes. Though it's not as lively as it in the daytime, there are fewer people here at night, so it's better for photoshoots.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_8@How did you know...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_1_9@All things in your search history are famous sights for photos, especially Willowbank Park.\nI guess you really want to see "that" in person.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_1@On a holiday morning, Monica suddenly opens her eyes on the bed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_10@player, if one day... I decide to go back to my original world... what will you do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_11@Her words bring up the hidden worry in my mind. I try to suppress my heartbreak and look into Monica's eyes seriously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_12@Of course I'll hold a farewell party for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_14@You'll surely sneak away then, won't you? And I will not let this kind of thing happen.\nI won't let you go before you say a proper goodbye to everyone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_15@... You rude man, why are you trying so hard to destroy my dignity as a queen?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_16@If you're alone, then it doesn't matter what identity you have, does it?\nSince you're a queen, we should hold a farewell party for you to fit your title.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_17@I know this day will finally come sooner or later, so I can't leave any regret.\nAll the times that I spend with you are worthy to be celebrated and farewelled with such a huge scale of party.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_18@... Of course, I'll be happier if you can stay with me for a longer time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_19@Monica bites her lip with her eyes brimming with misty water.\nBut soon, she puts back her usual haughty face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_2@The power... it's from Valkyria?! Where is──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_20@Since you've asked... before the day you wake up from your good dream, you should keep serving me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_3@... It's gone? Was it just a space fissure that appeared for an instant?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_6@Your Majesty, here's your pancake. Would you like to add some honey, chocolate, or player's homemade special sauce?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_7@Whatever. You can make the decision.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_8@... You didn't scold me for being rude... Are you feeling ill?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P015_N_2_9@Monica remains silent and raises her head with determination.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_1@Hmm~ My bangs are still a little askew...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_12@And nobody... has come to open the door...\nIs there anyone here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_13@Get back here—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_14@Hm? Voices... coming from inside?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_15@That's mine─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_16@I hear voices... So it wasn't just me. But... why isn't anyone coming to open the door? \nFine... I may as well try knocking...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_17@Clunk─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_18@The do-door wasn't closed... It's not my fault! Miyu didn't expect the door to be open...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_19@Hehee~ Yui, you can never catch me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_2@A strange girl stood in front of the gate of player's squirt gun team, constantly checking her reflection in the mirror.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_20@Bang bang bang─!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_21@Pow pow boom─!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_22@Aaaaaahh─!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_23@Wha-what's happening in there...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_24@I'll ju-just take a little peek...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_25@Darn~~~~ you~~~!!\nRina, take this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_26@Bang─!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_27@...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_29@Ah... Yui... I think you just smashed the cake on a stranger...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_3@Alright... This should be good. The first impression is the most important!... I'm so nervous...\nAs soon as I get in, I'll say hi to everyone with my cutest voice and friendliest smile!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_30@Look what you have done!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_31@Aaaahh~~ I'm... sorry~~!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_32@Are you okay? Wake up~~~ Sob sob~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_4@And then~ I'll present them this cake that I stood three hours in line for!\nPerfect! I'll definitely get along with everyone!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_5@Miyu, pull yourself together...\nIf you get kicked out again this time... There will be nowhere for you to stay anymore!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_6@After cheering herself up in front of the door, the girl took a deep breath as a final preparation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_7@Alright~! Miyu is fully ready!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_1_8@Ding-dong─ Ding-dong─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_1@Pant... pant... Who would ever... jog on the beach... beneath the heavy sun... on the first day of joining a team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_10@Oh god, oh god, oh god~ The coach seems like a gentle person! And he cares about me a lot... Is this for real?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_11@Alright~ Anyway, let me know if you have any problem...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_12@Yes... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_13@Oh... Yes, and here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_15@Don't push yourself too hard. Have this energy drink. Cheer up~\nI still have to go check on the other teammates.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_16@Thank... thank you Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_17@Oh god~~~ He just touched my head!! I'm going to faint!\nHe also prepared a cool energy drink for me... Crap... Miyu... Miyu is going to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_18@Hey! Newbie!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_19@Are... are... are you talking to me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_2@I remember it's... Miyu, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_20@Duh~ Who's new here except you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_21@It hurts!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_22@Look, Coach assigned you to my group. That means you'll have to listen to me.\nDon't you get any funny ideas now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_24@Like right now! Who allowed you to stop?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_25@But... but Coach asked me not to push myself too hard...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_26@Whose group are you in right now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_27@Rina's...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_28@Then whose words are you supposed to follow...? Huh?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_29@Ri... Rina's...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_3@Uh... Co-coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_30@Humph! Then you know what to do now!\nWhen Coach is not here, I'm the boss!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_31@Yes... I'll continue jogging...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_32@Ri~~ na~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_34@I~ heard~ everything~ you~ said~!\nCome to me afterwards. I'm going to have to drill some common sense into you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_35@Tsk... Fine!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_36@Coach... saved Miyu again...\nCoach... why are you so kind to me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_4@Woah woah woah! I got busted slacking off here... What do I do?... Coach is definitely going to scold me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_5@Are you okay? I remember today is your first day... \nI'm sorry to arrange this kind of tough training on your first day...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_6@I... I'm fine... I'll be ok after a little more rest...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_7@Is that so? Don't push yourself too hard. I saw that you were a bit unsteady on your feet on that second run...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_8@Coach... Were you always there behind me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_2_9@Hehe~ Yes. Since you've just transferred to our team, I'm pretty worried about whether you can catch up to the training here. Moreover, there are several troublemakers in our team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_01@Phew... now it should be about a third done...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_02@Humph, how dare the doofus Coach ask me to clean the whole dormitory!\nAaaaaah~! The newbie is to blame!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_03@Damn... I'll have to think of some ideas to get back at this newbie!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_04@Boom─!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_05@Yeeeeeehh~~ Coach! I'm sorry! I... I'm really cleaning hard!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_06@So... sorry... It's me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_07@Tsk... It's you...\nAre you here to mock me?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_08@No... I, I'm not! I'm here to help you clean the dormitory...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_09@He-help me clean?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_10@Ehehe... How should I put it...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_11@I think I'm kind of responsible for... Rina's punishment... So...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_12@You...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_14@Are you a fool or something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_15@Hm... What─?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_16@I was bullying you like that! And instead of making fun of me in private, you're here to get punished with me. I think a fool is already smarter than what you are...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_17@Ehehe... Ma-maybe... My ex-teammates used to say the same thing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_18@However... Miyu doesn't want to experience it again... teammates fighting and leading to the break up of the team... because of some trivial arguments...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_20@Therefore... Rina can bully me however you want... As long as we work together towards the same goal and give our blood, sweat, and tears... I'm willing to put up with anything...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_21@Hey... Looks like I misunderstood you earlier...\nAlright. I guess we can continue... the cleaning work now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_22@Rina... Captain...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_23@Hehe~ It's all for the team, isn't it!\nWe'll have to do it faster, or Coach will come and mumble like forever.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_25@So... Rina was really cleaning, huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_26@Hehe~ That's right! Rina and I tidied up the whole dormitory together!\nPlease compliment me~ Coach~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_27@But... I only asked you to check on her... I didn't expect you to do the work with her. You're such a good girl...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_28@Hehe~ You're exaggerating~ Coach~ Compliment me more~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_29@But... I just got the letter from your ex-coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_30@...?!\nI... I think I've got something else to do. I'll now go to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_31@He wants me to watch out... He has just left the rehab hospital...\nI really didn't expect a tiny girl like you... to have such a strong desire for that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_32@Ehehe... now that you know about it... I don't have to hide it anymore...\nI can't help it~ I just like that kind of feeling~ especially when they treat me so gently...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_33@... Why are you looking at me like that...? Are you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_34@Coach... Do you hate playful girls like Miyu...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_35@Don't... don't give me puppy eyes like that... Well... How should I put it...\nNo... I don't hate it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_36@Ehehe~ Wonderful~ As someone who can accept Miyu like this, Coach is becoming more and more like Miyu's ideal man~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_37@Crap~! What... what have I just said... Darn...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_3_38@Looks like Miyu... is a formidable girl...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_01@Girls, the competition will start in an hour. If you have finished warming up, you can go to the court first~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_02@Sob... no matter how many games I've been in, I still get so nervous before every game...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_03@Captain Rina, let me help you!\nMiyu is good at massaging!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_04@Eh? F-fine, since you looked so excited about it...\nBut I don't want to get hurt before the game. Be sure to do it more gently!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_05@You can leave it to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_06@Ahhh~ There...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_07@How is it~ Miyu knows the best spots that are the most relaxing for women!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_08@No... I'm about to be turned on... S-stop it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_09@Okay, okay. Now your body should be relaxed properly, Captain Rina.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_10@... Oh... It's... it's really working!\nThank you, Miyu!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_11@Ehehe~ Don't mention it. As long as we work hard together, nothing can stop us!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_12@Attention, girls! Thirty minutes before the match starts! Prepare to enter the court!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_13@Thanks to Miyu, my body is ready!\nGirls, let's go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_14@Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_15@Alright... I should go...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_17@Uh... Miyu?... Why are you blocking my way?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_18@Hey~ Coach~\nHow much time did you say we have before the match?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_19@Thir-thirty minutes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_20@To be honest~ Miyu is really nervous too... The muscles on my whole body are so tight♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_21@Miyu... While you're talking to me, you actually don't have to get so close...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_22@Miyu helped the other girls to ease their anxiety and pressure, but nobody could help Miyu...\nMiyu is afraid that I might be too nervous to even move... Coach... you're the only one that can help Miyu♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_23@How... how do you want me to help you...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_24@Touch Miyu's body... Massage Miyu's muscles that get so tight because of nervousness...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_25@Of course... If it's necessary... you can reach your hands inside Miyu's clothes as well♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_26@Mi-miyu... The match is about to begin... Don't... don't joke around like that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_27@Miyu... is not joking... Miyu really likes Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_28@Come on... We don't have a lot of time. Let's make love!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_29@You...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_30@Hehee~ Couch got pushed down by Miyu♥\nIf Coach wants to resist, you can push Miyu away anytime~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_4_31@But if Coach is not doing anything, Miyu will have to ask Coach... to help relax Miyu's body~\nEhehe~♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_1@The mega tournament is coming after a few weeks, so the following training will be group competitions for you to get familiar with the competitions.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_11@Ah, Ahh~ Th-There... Ummm~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_12@Even Miss Itsuki is letting out such voices... Miss Miyu is realy skilled.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_13@Ehehe, you're exaggerating. Miyu is happy enough to be able to help you guys.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_14@The first thing Rina sees when she steps into the living room is Miyu being surrounded by other girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_15@Miyu... What are you doing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_16@Ah, Captain Rina! I'm massaging for everyone so that all of us can compete in our best status!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_17@You doofus! You're giving away our advantage in the group competition!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_18@A-Am I? But Captain is good enough to win just with your skill!\nThat's my humble opinion...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_19@... That's also a correct thought.\nOur performance against other opponents is the most important. Let's compete for the inner competition with our own skills. And don't you get in my way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_2@The first match... let's do it with the group you're usually in.\nThe winning group will be rewarded a 3-day vacation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_21@After Rina leaves, Akane nods and sighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_22@Instead of your massaging skill, I feel Miyu's skill in taming Rina is the best.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_3@Hehehehe...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_4@... Rina, why are you smirking so pervertedly?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_5@Y-You're the pervert! I'm merely getting excited about the following tournament!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_6@Is that so... Anyway, that's it if you don't have any other question. Dismissed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_8@Hehehe~ As long as we have Miyu, our group will be invincible! I've got the 3-day vacation!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_1_9@Now that I think about it, it has been a long time since the last time I have Miyu's massage... Where did she go?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_1@Time flies. It's the tournament next week.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_10@Miyu dusts off the confetti in shock and sees the banner hanging in the living room and all the girls standing beneath it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_11@You guys... How did you know it's my birthday?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_12@It's written in all members' personal information.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_13@Miyu always works so much behind the scenes, so we've planned to give you a surprise birthday party.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_14@Stop standing there like a fool and come on in! Or the cake Kana make is going to be cold!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_15@Itsuki takes over the bag of pudding while Rina tries to hold Miyu's hands. However, Miyu turns away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_16@What── Hey, don't tell me you're crying?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_17@Miyu, Miyu is just... too happy...\nMiyu never thinks about getting anything in return while doing these...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_18@You'll always get something in return if you work hard! Miyu can just consider it the rewards of you working so hard every day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_19@That's right. Having everyone celebrating for you, isn't it worth it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_2@Everyone has been so tough recently. I shall buy some pudding for them!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_20@Miyu shakes her head with a happy smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_21@No. Instead of having you celebrating my birthday... being in such a friendly team is the biggest reward for Miyu.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_23@Hehe~ Naive girls. Everything is going as I've planned.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_24@Miyu~ will never be hated by anyone! Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_4@Heya... Carrying so much pudding at the same time is pretty tough. Now, where's my key...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_5@Clank.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_6@What? The door's opened?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_7@Miyu pushes open the door with her shoulder. Before she steps into the dorm, she hears a bang. Lots of confetti is shot into the air and falls onto Miyu's head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_8@Woah?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P016_N_2_9@Happy birthday~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_1@Hey... Let me ask you a question... Have you guys ever accidentally stumbled into a completely foreign space while passing a familiar place?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_10@It didn't look anything like a bathroom inside... Instead, it looked like somewhere I'd never been before...\nAnd it was in the depths of the room...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_11@What... What's there...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_12@Stop... Stop scaring me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_13@There's a blurry shadow... if it's a person, it isn't moving... but it's too large to be a cat or a dog...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_14@Could... could it be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_15@And I saw the blurry shadow suddenly stand up... and walked towards me...\nIn the shadow's hand... there seemed to be something like a sharp knife...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_16@And then what happened~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_17@Hey!! Do you know what time it is? Go to bed already!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_18@Aaaaaahhh~~ It's the shadow~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_19@What...? Why did they run away screaming...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_21@Pant... Pant... Pant... Kana's story... was way too scary...\nHaaahh... I was so scared...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_22@Am I the only one to end up escaping here...? Why are all the lights here off...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_23@And... Where is... this?\nIt's... it's like I haven't been here before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_25@Yyy... Yeeeeeek──!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_26@...You... can see me...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_27@Aaaaaah~~ Th-there she is!!\nThe Mi-miss F in the legend!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_28@...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_3@Actually... that space has been there all the time...\nThis legend had circulated around this dorm far before I joined this team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_30@Hey... Wake up... Miyu... Wake up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_32@Co-coach!\nGreat... I'm still alive...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_34@Yyy... Yeeeeeek──!\nThat... that shadow...! It's F... Miss F!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_35@Hey... Where are your manners? She is Fuuko, our most senior member...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_4@There was once a student called Miss F, who was bullied by her classmates. One day, Miss F invited the bullies to her dorm room to meet her where she then cut her throat with a sharp knife, ending her life in front of everyone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_5@Not long after, the bullies who witnessed the suicide were found dead in their own rooms. What's even weirder, their cause of death was almost the same as Miss F's, yet no knife was ever found at the scenes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_6@After that, it seemed like Miss F's room completely disappeared from this dorm... However, some people still claimed that they had seen the mysterious room in person...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_7@A-and... then...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_8@One day... I was busy with something till midnight... After finishing my cleaning and cooking chores, I thought about going to the bathroom...\nSo I walked along the pitch-black hallway...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_1_9@I counted the doors along the way. One... two... three...\nThe fourth door was supposed to be the bathroom... but when I opened the fourth door and walked in...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_1@Oh... So... we have a member called... Fuuko...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_10@Sigh... I knew it... Even after two years, I haven't changed at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_11@Two years ago...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_19@A Squirt gun team... If I join it... can I become as dazzling as everyone else and finally be noticed...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_2@Yes... Even I had almost forgotten about her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_21@Two years have passed... Still, nobody can see me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_22@No~ That's not true~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_23@You... you can see me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_24@Ever since you scared me last time, I have been constantly reminding myself to notice your existence~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_26@Angel... You're an angel!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_27@Hehe~ My name is Miyu. I'm new to this team. Nice to meet you~ senior team member, Fuuko!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_28@Senior... You're calling me a senior... Oh... So this is the feeling of being noticed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_29@Hey~ Miyu! Come here! I still need you to massage me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_30@No problem~ I'll be there in a minute~ You still want me to massage the same part today, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_31@Miyu! Don't forget our training afterwards!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_32@Sure, sure! Training the lower body is Miyu's favorite~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_33@She seems... so busy... and radiant from being relied on so much...\nWhat's more... she can even look me in the eyes with her pure gaze...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_34@Can I ever become... a girl like Miyu?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_4@Coach... Then how did she join the team? You should have some recollection, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_5@I'm here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_6@Hmm... My blurry memory recalls that Fuuko came to join the team, but then I was too busy with training... and then...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_7@Well... The reason why I joined was...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_8@By the way... Coach... Do you see a shadow there in the corner...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_2_9@Hm? Shadow...? Where?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_1@Hehe~ Miyu's handmade chocolate is completed~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_10@Why do I keep hearing a faint sound?\nWho... who is hiding there?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_11@... I... I'm not hiding... I've always been here next to you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_12@Oh... You're... Fuuko?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_13@Yes... Is there anything wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_14@No... It's nothing... It's just that... you suddenly appeared next to me... Were you already here when I was making the chocolate?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_15@Actually... I was already here when you brought the chocolate from the living room to the kitchen...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_16@Gosh... So you saw and heard everything?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_17@Yes... You can say that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_18@Then... what do you want...? Could it be that you're going to forrce me to take some le-lewd pictures...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_19@No, no, no~ I don't want to do anything like that... I just want to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_2@... But... didn't you buy it directly from somewhere?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_20@So you DO want something...\nAhh... Seems like Miyu is about to be kicked out from this team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_21@No... I've always admired Miyu...\nI wouldn't do anything to harm you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_22@I just want you... to teach me... how to become so popular, so noticeable... and so eye-catching... just like you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_23@No problem~ I'll teach you! But, you need to promise me something in exchange.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_24@What... what is it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_25@First, Miyu likes it here a lot and wants to be everyone's friend. Therefore, you can never reveal to anyone what I might secretly do to achieve certain goals!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_26@I definitely don't have any problem with that... I don't like to expose other people's secrets...\nEven though I did learn quite a few because everybody treated me like air...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_27@Secondly, Coach... belongs to everyone. No hogging him for yourself! Is that clear?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_28@Uh... Well... Yes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_29@I thought there would be some tough requests... but these aren't a problem at all... Even though Coach really is a nice and good-looking guy... he would never fall for someone like me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_3@Let Miyu test the flavor first~\nHmm... Heavy nuts flavor with a slight bitterness... Chocolate bought from the shop always tastes so great~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_30@Hmm...? What are you talking about...?\nIn Miyu's Men-seducing Class, I'll make all men unable to resist your charm!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_31@Wha-what?! Is... is that true?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_32@Hehehe~ Just wait and see... Miyu will hereby perform my miraculous make-up magic!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_4@Bring back store-bought chocolate, re-melt it, and pour it into another mold~\nAnd~ a delicious and sincere gift is completed right away!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_5@Is... is this really okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_6@And Miyu will wear my 20D sheer tights~ The silky skin of my almost bare feet will definitely turn every man on!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_7@20... 20D? Bare...? Wait, wait, wait...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_8@And I'll put some aphrodisiacal herbs inside as well~ so that Coach will pounce on me as soon as he eats this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_3_9@Eh... This is... isn't this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_1@Our opponents for the next match are all seasoned veterans, and their squirt guns seem to emphasize squirting power...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_10@Oh... Come on in...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_11@... Please... enjoy the tea...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_12@You... You are...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_13@I... I'm Fuuko... D-do you still remember me? Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_14@Hehe~ Very well. Miyu's make-up technique successfully made a good first impression!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_15@Are you guys... discussing something...? Well, if you don't mind... F-fuuko wants to join the discussion as well...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_16@Su-sure...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_17@Then... I'll take a seat here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_18@Eh... So close all of a sudden...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_19@Hehee... Miyu's 1st Seducing Technique, Sudden Approach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_2@Even though the rate of fire of their squirt guns is low... It'll be no joke to take a single hit...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_20@Suddenly approaching a man while he is off guard will not only make his heart all aflutter, but also sometimes we can get some unexpected reactions~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_21@You... have such a fragrant smell...?\nCrap... What am I talking about... Sorry... No offense...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_22@Hehe~ It's okay... All this is especially for Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_23@Uh... Did you just say... for me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_24@No... Nothing... Sorry... Please just pretend that you didn't hear that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_25@Hehee... Miyu's 2nd Seducing Technique, Take a Step Back to Dash Forward!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_26@When a man compliments you, pretend to accidentally reveal your inner thoughts. As for whether that is really what you're thinking... it doesn't matter at all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_27@Coach... Why are you staring at me...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_28@I... Nothing... Let's continue the di-discussion...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_29@Hehe~ Now's the perfect timing... Coach should already be desperate now... The unavoidable presence of Fuuko's breasts... and the traps I've set earlier... have chained together to become a combo attack!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_3@Hehe~ Coach~ Miyu has an idea~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_30@Let me take care of things... from here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_31@Aah~ Coach, Miyu forgot that I have to massage Rina afterwards! Miyu will leave for about an hour and come back later~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_32@Got... got it... Thank you for your hard work...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_33@Alright... Fuuko, I've created an intimate space with only the two of you. You've done a great job so far~ Just look forward to how Coach will react next!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_34@Mi-miyu... You're amazing... I've never been stared at like this... I can feel my body turning so hot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_35@No problem! Just see how Coach is infatuated right now... Just blow in his ear and tell him how your body is feeling right now... and he'll be yours~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_36@Good luck~ It's your own battle from now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_37@Th-thank you! Miyu...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_4@Hm? What is it? Tell me about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_5@We just have to send out a member who can decelerate enemies as well as minimize their threat by acting as a decoy to take most of the damage...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_6@While she is tanking the damage, the others can concentrate fire on the enemies. Is this strategy able to disrupt their formation?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_7@Hmm... What you're saying makes a lot of sense... But who should this member be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_8@Nadeshiko? Even though she can take most of the damage, she cannot block the enemies...\nOr Alice? She can block the enemies well, but she won't be able to hold them off for too long with her stamina...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_4_9@Coach... I've got some tea here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_1@After explaining the strategy that Miyu has suggested to all members attending the match today, the whistle is blown.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_10@As if she heard my cheer, Fuuko runs towards the opponents and attacks them right before them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_11@What happened?! There's an attack from somewhere with no one!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_12@No! There's someone! Even though it's really hard to notice it but someone is getting really close to us!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_13@Are you serious?! Damn! Focus our firepower on her then!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_14@Ugh! I can do it~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_15@Fuuko's low sense of existence makes it hard for the opponents to aim at her, which earns a lot of chances for other teammates to attack the opponents who are focusing on Fuuko. The strategy eventually brings the team a nice victory.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_16@Fuuko sis, you're the best!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_17@I-Is that so? But Yui was still the MVP in this game...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_18@Were it not for Fuuko, we wouldn't have gotten this victory.\nYou were the true MVP today!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_19@Look, the audience is applauding you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_2@... That's it. If you don't have anything more to ask, go and do your best.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_20@I point at the spectator seating where the shouts of "Fuuko, Fuuko" can slightly be heard from the thunderous cheers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_21@So... I'm also... noticed by them...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_22@So this is how it feels to be noticed...\nAhh... Coach, and guys, thank you so much! I'll keep fighting hard!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_3@Miyu will fight hard!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_4@Let's fight together!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_5@O-Okay...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_6@(As the core of the strategy, Fuuko doesn't look confident at all. Is it really okay...?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_7@With worries, I see Fuuko step onto the match field cowering.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_8@After the game starts, just like I've expected, the slow but powerful shots from the opponents are restraining Miyu and Yui from approaching them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_1_9@Fuuko... Go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_1@After such an extraordinary performance on the match field, Fuuko has gained special attention from others. However, there a tiny consequence that troubles me a little...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_10@Hm? What are you talking about?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_11@Nothing. Watch out when you walk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_12@After brushing Alice off, I lower my head to look at Fuuko, who is quietly in my arms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_13@The soft fragrance and her cute face hiding behind her glasses... how could I ignore her existence just like others?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_14@Coach, thank you... You did notice me there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_15@Of course I did.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_16@In fact, "I'm the only one to notice Fuuko" miraculously sounds like she belongs to me.\nBut if she is ignored by even her teammates from time to time, it would really be trouble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_17@You do need some support here. Fuuko, this is for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_18@It's... a bracelet? There's also a heart-shaped bell on it. That's so cute.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_19@With the noise you make while walking, you shouldn't be ignored like that. And the accidents of people bumping into you can be reduced, too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_2@Hehehee, the black candles I ordered have finally arrived. Judging by their heavy weight~ They must be imbued with a tremendous power of chaos~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_20@I urge Fuuko to put on the bracelet.\nAlong her moves, the bell tinkles clearly and softly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_21@It feels like I'm wearing Coach's heart on my wrist. I'll cherish it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_3@What kind of strange thing did Alice buy again... Hm? Isn't that Fuuko?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_4@Alice... Your package looks heavy. Do you need any help?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_5@Should I arrange them into a pentagram or a hexagram...? Huhuu~ I should try both~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_6@Hey! You're bumping into her! Watch out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_7@I pull Fuuko into my arms to avoid Alice running into her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_8@Coach? Why are you standing here alone? Could it be that you've sensed the evil power gathering in my hands?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P017_N_2_9@... Didn't you notice at all?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_1@The test purpose of today's experiment is to find the solubility constant of silver acetate under different temperature conditions...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_11@Rise here. How may I help you, Principal...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_12@Sorry to interrupt you when you're so busy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_13@Well, at least you feel sorry, Principal... I was in the middle of an experiment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_14@You... Fine... \nThere will be a guest coming to visit our school later today. I need you to help...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_15@A guest? More like a whole lot of trouble... There are so many other people you could ask for help. Why me?\nI still have a lot of experiments to run...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_16@It was decided by the board of directors. You know, some of the directors are sponsoring the squirt gun competition...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_17@You mean the sport with a bunch of girls splashing around? I've been seeing their ads on TV a lot recently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_18@It's pretty impressive that you actually know what I'm talking about. Then you should have something to talk about with the guest!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_19@I'm not particularly interested in the sport. I just happened to see it when waiting for my analysis results... Is there anyone that can go in my place...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_2@Yo yo yo~ Wanna bet whether Rise has changed her bra today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_20@No! The coach of that squirt gun team asked us for someone with a talent in chemistry. You're the only candidate in my mind, so good luck!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_21@How troublesome...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_22@I wonder if the students are properly conducting the silver acetate experiment... How troublesome... I'd rather be surrounded by beakers than a group of strangers...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_23@Ah... Ouch... \nMy lab coat...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_24@Ah... Sorry. Are you alright? My cake stained your coat...\nI'm so sorry about that, but... I'm in a rush right now. Please give me a chance to make it up to you next time we meet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_26@Sigh... Today is really not my day... I couldn't finish my experiment; I was given a troublesome task; and now, someone in a rush bumped into me and dirtied my lab coat...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_27@Good thing I have plenty of lab coats and nothing else got stained, since I'm not wearing anything inside... \nI'll just take it off and put on another one.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_29@Excuse me. I'm the coach of a squirt gun team. Your school's board of directors introduced me here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_3@Haha~ Why not! I bet she hasn't changed her bra in three days!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_31@S-sorry! I... I'm no-not a pervert! I didn't mean it! I wasn't peeking!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_32@You... Are you the guy who just bumped into me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_33@I... I don't know!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_34@Could you at least look at me? Didn't your parents teach you to look at someone when you're talking to them...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_35@Then... then... then could you at least put some clothes on? \nWhere on earth do you expect me to put my eyes~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_4@Students... Please cut the chitchat... This experiment is quite dangerous... \nAlso, for convenience's sake, I'm not wearing anything inside...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_5@Things like clothes and underwear only cause unnecessary trouble during experiments... \nIf possible, I always prefer not to wear anything underneath my lab coat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_6@Alright, returning back to the experiment. I'll be using the precipitation titration method later with iron(III) as our indicator and start the titration with a standard solution...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_7@The experiment... is ready to start...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_8@Attention. Attention. Teaching Assistant Rise, please head to the Academic Affairs Office...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_1_9@Tsk... I've just started the experiment! How troublesome... Hope it won't take too long...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_1@So, do you... usually exhibit your body to others like this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_10@Well... that covered most of it, but our rules are lax enough that as long as it isn't harmful... it doesn't necessarily have to be liquid...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_11@Then... what about shooting caesium and water and mixing them in mid-air? \nWe could have them in two seperate pressurized containers and have the streams collide...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_12@What... what would happen...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_13@Well... a quite beautiful explosion...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_14@Ex-explosion... That is definitely not okay... H-how about the next idea?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_15@Fine... How about mercury(II) thiocyanate? Just add a little fire and it will react immediately, forming a Pharaoh's serpent...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_16@That sounds impressive... What is a Pharaoh's serpent?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_17@A coiling snake-shaped solid will be formed. It might be able to tangle the opponents or scare them away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_18@It doesn't sound so cool anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_19@That's not even the best part! During combustion, it'll create a great deal of toxic gas, which is definitely harmful to the opponent!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_2@Mhmm... Is there a problem with that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_20@To-toxic gas... That's way too dangerous! No way Jose!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_21@Stop being such a negative Nancy... Why are there so many rules in this so-called squirt gun competition...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_22@That's not the case... It's only because your ideas are either impractical or too dangerous... Don't you have any more mild ideas?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_23@Sigh... How troublesome... That's why I hate talking to people...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_24@Let's put it this way. Is there anything that can immobilize someone, block their sight, and is harmless to the human body...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_25@Glue...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_26@G-glue?! Teaching Assistant, are you brushing me off...?\nHow can something like that ever immobilize someone?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_27@Hehe~ It's nothing like the ordinary glue you usually see. It's the latest material I recently developed. It has amazing tenacity and viscosity, and there are no side effects!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_28@That's wonderful... May I see it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_29@Okay... But I'll need some more time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_3@A-a problem...? Isn't this an inconvenience to other people?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_30@Some more time... I thought you already have it with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_31@Ge-get off my back! While I'm researching, you all love to interrupt me one after another, and now you're asking for the results right now? Don't you think it's too good to be true?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_32@I... I apologize... I know my visit here is really abrupt...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_33@I'm glad you know! You said you would make it up to me if you had the chance. Well, now's the perfecet chance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_34@Uhh... How should I make it up to you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_35@Be my assistant and help me with the experiment. Right now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_36@Okay... What should I do then...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_37@Take off your clothes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_39@Take Off Your Clothes! Which word don't you understand? Do you want your skin to be stuck to your clothes by my super viscous glue?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_4@But it's much more convenient for experiments... What's more, I don't think my body... has anything worth noticing... Right? Look...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_40@Wait... Didn't you say it's safe?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_41@I didn't get the chance to complete all of my research yet!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_42@Aaaaahhh~ That's so irritating!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_43@Hold on a second! Don't start taking your clothes off in the middle of a conversation!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_44@It's such a waste of time to explain things to you. I'll just show you with our bodies!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_45@Listen to me!!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_5@Hey! Could you try listening to me like for a minute?! Just stop undressing yourself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_7@Phew... Finally...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_8@So... Teaching Assistant Rise, when you were putting your clothes back on and listening to my introduction about the squirt gun competition, did you come up with anything that might enhance our equipments or weapons?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_2_9@So in the squirt gun competition, anything can be shot from the squirt guns as long as it's a liquid?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_1@Mix polyvinyl alcohol with water for viscosity, and add just the right amount of borax water into it. But how much borax water makes the perfect ratio...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_10@Ah... The mucus in my previous experiment...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_11@Aaaahh~!\nIs it toxic?! Will it corrode your skin?! How should I help you?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_12@It's fine... Don't worry... It shouldn't be toxic according to the ingredients I used...\nIt's just...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_13@It's just...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_14@It's just so sticky... and so tingly... so tingly that I want to dig into my skin with my fingers...\nBut how can I tell him something like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_15@It's fine! Just help me up... and we'll clean the mucus afterwards...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_16@Alright... Put your hand here on my shoulder. I'll pull you up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_19@Are you okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_2@Well... Let's test this amount first... and to make it "girl friendly," I should make it more fragrant by adding some... farnesol...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_20@This... feeling... coursing through me... It's tingly... but f-feels good...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_21@Is everything alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_22@Y-yes... Let's... let's continue...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_23@Fine... Then I'll continue...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_24@Uhm... Ahh... No... You can't... not there...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_25@Hm...? Rise... Your face is really red... are you feeling sick from the mucus?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_26@No! It's... not!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_27@It feels so... so good... Every single time he touches my body, it reacts abnormally... just like the excitatory function of the sympathetic nervous system...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_28@No... I can't let him know how I'm feeling now... That's just... so embarrassing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_29@No... Don't touch me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_3@Hmm... Smells pretty good. And now to stir it to accelerate the reaction...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_30@But... can you do it by yourself?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_31@Y-yes... I just have to take off my clothes... and clean my body with some water...\nCould you... turn around... please...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_32@No problem...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_33@Why... why am I caring about his gaze so much...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_34@Here, take this. My shirt isn't stained by mucus. Use it to cover yourself up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_35@Okay... Thanks...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_36@Actually... he can still be pretty sweet and considerate...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_4@The viscosity still looks too low... and player hasn't come back with what I asked him to get...\nWhat a slowpoke...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_5@Aaaah~ I don't want to wait any longer! I'll just use cyanoacrylate for the viscosity!\nIt should be here... Who on earth put this in such a high place?... How troublesome...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_6@Woohoo... Finally gotcha. How much should I put in...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_7@Rise! Rise! I got what you wanted!\nLet's continue the experiment!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_8@Woooooaaaah~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_3_9@Rise~! Sorry... I bumped into you again... Are you okay?\nWhat's that liquid on you...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_1@How many experiments does that make now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_10@Before it starts... I'll have to take a small break...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_11@Rise... has been acting kinda wierd lately. Don't push yourself too hard. Have some rest...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_12@Ah... his hand is on me again... My body... is feeling the same way like last time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_14@Ahh... I just can't... get rid of this... scorching feeling inside my body...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_15@No way... Neither the comforter nor the Coach Hug Pillow I made is working...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_16@If my body keeps growing more and more sensitive... I'll really go crazy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_17@Do... do you want to try it...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_18@How... how can I ever say this kind of thing to him... Aaaaahh~ How troublesome~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_19@(The next day)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_2@The 34th... Is there a problem?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_20@Teaching Assistant Rise...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_21@How should I put it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_22@Teaching Assistant Rise...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_23@The most direct way is probably pushing him down... and then ask... \nBut... do normal people really do it this way?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_24@Teaching Assistant Rise!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_25@Y-yes...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_26@I've called you so many times... Were you thinking about how you're going to perform the 35th experiment?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_27@Uh... No... I mean... Yes! Yes! That's what I was thinking about! Right!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_28@Ahahaha! Let's... let's hurry up and get started!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_29@I'm planning to add some glycerol this time, since it might help with the dehydration... Let's add some and see how it works...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_3@No... I just feel that everytime you're the only one to sense the failure... though it's true that I mostly know nothing about the experiments...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_30@Then let me help you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_31@No... Don't... Just don't touch me now...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_32@Wa-watch out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_33@Ahh~ This feeling... is coming again... In the morning I just... Aaaahum~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_34@Are you okay...? You almost fell just now. I wanted to give you a hand to avoid any injury...\nBut I ended up falling with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_35@Ha-having... having a man on me... I... I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_36@Are you okay? Can you get up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_37@Let's do this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_38@The experiment?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_39@Not the experiment...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_4@You don't have to know anything! Just listen to me and assist me during this experiment!\nI'll give an order and you'll carry it out! Is it that hard?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_40@Then what...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_41@Another experiment...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_42@Ri-rise...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_5@Alright alright... I'll pass you this beaker...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_6@No... Don't touch me!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_4_9@The 35th experiment is now ready to go...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_1@Having Rise's soft body pressed beneath me makes me scorchingly thirsty.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_10@My soulmate, you're too late! How dare you dump me downstairs! I've already drawn the summoning magic circle with my foot... Hm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_11@Outside the opened door stands Alice, who made a huge scene to ask me to bring her here to the school. And inside the door lie Rise and me, whose clothes are loosened indecently...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_12@... My soulmate. The flame from the purgatory is burning in my heart. I can't suppress my impulse to connect my spiritual airwave with the rule protectors...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_13@No, no, no! Don't call the police! There's a reason! I can explain!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_15@... So that's the whole story. Do you understand?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_16@I don't understand at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_17@Alice turns her head around. Seems like instead of not able to understand it, she's not able to accept it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_18@We have undergone those evil tortures to build the flesh we possess now. But my soulmate, you're telling me that you want help from fly-like science? Are you looking down on us?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_19@I can't just ignore what you said... The width and depth of science is not something a little day-dreaming girl like you can understand...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_2@Rise, about the other kind of experiment, do you mean... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_20@You...! Humph, I shall take the high road and forgive the coward who doesn't stand on the battlefield.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_21@That means... if I can use science in the competitions, you'll be able to understand how great it is? Very well... It's indeed faster when executing it in person than explaining the theories. And it's helpful for spreading the knowledge of science.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_22@player. Prepare a lab for me... I'll be temporarily joining your team as the consultant of it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_23@... I do love the consequence, but why exactly did it end up like this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_24@And how can the science geek communicate with the weeb...? I just can't see any connection between their languages. There are just so many mysterious things in the world.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_3@It's about the difference between physical reactions. Though I assume it's the effect made by the experimental slime, the physical difference that happens after the skin touches objects is more complicated. Thus it needs to be analyzed one step after another...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_4@... Why could someone speak all these sentences in alien language while blushing? You're completely cooling me down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_5@Alright. Since you're now doing an experiment, I'll get up from you first... Woaaah?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_6@Rise suddenly pulls me by my hand, making me lose my balance and fall back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_7@No way. You're an important catalytic in this experiment, so you're not leaving before I finish it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_8@What do you mean──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_1_9@Clank!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_1@Since Rise joined the team, our weapons have been enhanced greatly and thus lead to a raising winning rate.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_10@If you tumble a lot... enhance the coordination of your arms and legs might improve the situation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_11@Uh, but Saki doesn't know how to enhance it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_12@In a long term, you can train your physical ability, and in a short term, you may invent a balance maintenance device to avoid your muscle remembering the wrong way of walking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_13@That sounds splendid! Can Rise do that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_14@... My main field is science, but it's not like I can't try out this kind of simple device...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_15@Th-thank you! Rise sis! Saki will also try to help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_16@Hehe, I can feel that Rise has grown a little different.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_18@When you first came, you were always burying your head in those researches without talking to anyone. But now you can tell me the length of relationships... which means you did some research on it. Am I right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_2@It's so good to have Rise here. Everyone has been so motivated recently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_20@What's more, you were willing to help Saki out. So I think maybe Rise is willing to stay for a longer time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_21@... I just realized that solving others' problems is more challenging and exciting than simply doing experiments... That's all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_22@If you don't have anything else to say, I want to start making the balance maintenance device as soon as possible... So I'll take my leave now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_23@Hehe, Rise is actually a nice person. Saki, don't you agree?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_3@... I don't quite understand the connection between the two incidents. But now that I have proven what science can do, I shall leave now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_4@What? You're leaving? I thought Rise will always be with us forever...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_5@Forever... This is not a logical saying. Take humans' lives for example, it can never last forever. On the other hand, the average length of relationships between two people is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_6@Clank!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_7@Sob...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_8@What's that noise? Saki? Oh my! Why did you tumble like this? Let me check on you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P018_N_2_9@Akane sis... I want to practice serving food to Coach, but I always accidentally kick the corner of the table or tumble by myself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_1@After I'm done with this house, I should be set to meet my monthly quota!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_10@Well... I should call it a day!\nAfter perfectly achieving my work goals, I'm now ready to retreat~ Yeah~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_11@Hmm...? There's an overpowering smell of gas...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_12@Crap... That thing I bumped into in the room that might have been kitchen... Could it be the gas switch?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_13@Gosh! I'll have to wake everyone up, or something really bad would happen!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_14@No... I can't... If I wake everyone up, I'll be exposed...\nThen I would have failed my mission... and my performance evaluation of this month will...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_15@Sob~! What am I even thinking!\nHow can I be so selfish in a matter of life and death!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_16@Darn it! I don't care anymore! I'll just turn on all the alarms!!\nAaah~ I forgot I turned them all off when I came in... What do I do now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_17@Ah! Yes, I've got it!\nThief! There's a thief in the house!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_18@Somebody, help! The thief is getting away!\nCome get meeeeeeee~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_19@What's the ruckus! Where's the thief?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_2@Hehe~ Let me complete this mission as fast and elegantly as possible!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_21@Are you the noisy thief?!\nI've never seen a thief who wakes the owners up on purpose while stealing things!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_22@Thief... How dare you interrupt a sweet night between Senpai and I... I won't let you off the hook!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_23@Hmm~ I didn't hear anything since I was sleeping with my headphones on... Miss Thief actually did a good job...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_24@I... I'm not a thief... Sob, sob...\nI'm just...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_25@Cut the crap! You can tell your lies to the police!\nTomoka, call the police! Yandere Chan and I will keep our eyes on her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_26@Sob... How did things end up like this... I was just here to deliver presents...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_27@Will I end up spending my time in prison till Christmas Eve...?\nWill Old Man Claus come visit me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_28@No way... If I get caught now, there's no way I can meet my monthly quota, and Santa Claus won't reward me with extra food... That way I won't be able to hole up in my room all safe and sound till next year...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_29@No way! I can't be caught now!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_3@Perfect~ I've sneaked in successfully while turning off the annoying surveillance cameras and anti-theft alarms...\nHmm... I think I might have turned off the carbon monoxide alarm too...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_30@Trying to run?! Yandere Chan, get her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_31@Hehe~ Leave it to me, Senpai~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_32@Heh! I won't let you catch me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_33@I knew you would run away from Yandere Chan and head this way. I've got you now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_34@Antler... You've got my antler... Let go~ It hurts~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_35@Hm? What are you talking about?\nWhy would you feel anything if I grab this accessory?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_36@It really hurts~~ I'm sorry... It's all my fault... Please let go of meaaaaaahh~\nSob... How did things turn out like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_37@Can this... possibly be a real antler...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_38@Senpai... Let me end the pathetic life of this thief!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_39@Wa-wait!! Yandere Chan~ Don't be so impulsive!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_4@Anyways~ It's not like anything will happen. I'll turn it back on again before I sneak out later~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_40@Haah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_42@Br-bro-ken... My antler... is broken...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_43@This... Is this a real antler? There are veins on the inside... It's even warm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_44@Here's my ch-chance...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_45@Wa-wait! Thief! Stop!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_46@Sob~~ I told you I'm not a thief~~\nToday is really not my day~~ Darn~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_5@Let's start with this room... I remember she wants a sharp ax...\nWhat on earth is she going to do with it... How frightening...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_6@And the next room... Ouch!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_7@It's too dark... What did I just bump into? Is this the kitchen?\nHow dangerous... I'll have to complain to Old Man Claus about occupational injuries...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_8@Alright... I can smell the scent of humans in this room. This should be the right one... Let me check her wish...\n"I want brand new headphones... preferably a noise-canceling one, with a silver cable..."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_1_9@Woah... Looks like she's a headphone connoisseur... Hope this set of headphones can satisfy her ears...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_11@Ah... It's you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_12@No... It's not me... It's not me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_13@You're the thief from the other day!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_14@Shhh! I'm not a thief! I have a name you know? My name is Miyuki! It means beautiful snow!\nLast but not least, I was saving your lives last time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_15@Why are you here? Are you trying to pickpocket someone?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_16@Why, why, why would I ever pickpocket anyone~!\nStop accusing me of something I didn't do!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_17@I'm just temporarily homeless, so I'm taking this part-time job of giving out tissue for people who need it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_18@While also granting people's wishes and stuff...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_19@Why don't you go home? Are you afraid of your family's reaction after knowing that you're a thief?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_2@Aah... It's this time of the season again... The winter festival...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_20@What are you talking about! Stop pushing my buttons!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_21@It's just... I didn't meet my performance quota, so I cannot go home...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_22@Really... How can there be a family like that... I'm sorry to hear that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_23@Besides... The antler on my head was broken by you... If it's not fixed, I don't have the ability to go back either...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_24@Now that I take a closer look... the antler on her head is still broken from the last time I saw it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_25@Could this antler and all she said before... be true?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_26@Is this... the antler you were talking about?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_27@...!!\nThat's my antler! Give it back to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_28@Is this really that important for you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_29@Yes... Give it back to me now~~ Sob... Stop being so mean to me...\nWithout this antler, I don't even have the ability to conjure presents for people and make their wishes come true...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_3@Hello~ Please have this~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_30@And if I can't deliver present or grant wishes, I'll never meet my performance quota and be able to go home...\nGive it back to me right now~~ Sob, sob...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_31@That's why you're here doing this part-time job on the street?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_32@That's right... I'm working on the street to see if I can grant any of their wishes...\nEven though I can't conjure presents anymore, if I can grant just one wishe, I might still be able to slowly fulfill my quota...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_33@Hmm... Even though it's still hard to believe all this, she seems pretty wretched...\nBut I must say, her crying face makes me want to joke with her some more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_34@Okay~ So that's how it is! Even though you look really pitiful right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_35@Yes! Uh huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_36@I'm still not forgiving you for trespassing!\nUnless you promise me one thing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_37@As long as... my life won't be in danger... I'll try my best to do whatever you want... since it's the main purpose of why I'm here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_38@You have to promise me that... I can have three wishes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_39@Al-alright... In order to get home, I can only promise you...\nWhat a greedy guy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_4@No... I'm in a hurry... Thanks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_5@As expected, lots of hotties are delivering flyers in mini skirts. This festival just reeks of capitalism...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_6@Damn... But I'm really envious!\nIf only some cutie in a short skirt could just come and talk to me right now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_7@If that is your wish...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_2_9@Then I'll...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_1@Miyuki! Follow me to the right later!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_11@Sob~ That guy is all to blame... He forced me to join the squirt gun team, saying he's short-staffed since most of the members are off on holiday...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_12@And that if I don't attend the competitions, the team won't be able to attend the league competition anymore...\nBut... I'm really not good at this kind of sports...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_13@Miyuki! Watch out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_14@Hm? What?...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_16@Sob... I'm... soaking wet~~ It's so cold...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_17@Beeeep! You're out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_18@Mi~yu~ki~!\nMeet me in the locker room later. We need a nice talk...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_19@Sob... Yes, sir...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_2@O-okay!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_21@Can you explain why you were so distracted in the competition just then?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_22@Well... I just... thought of some embarrassing things in the past...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_23@How embarrassing? Like breaking into someone's house and stealing things?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_24@I told you I wasn't a thief! I saved all your lives!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_25@Oh? How are you going to prove it~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_26@How can I... ever prove it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_27@It's okay~ Sounds like you don't want this antler anymore~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_28@I offered you this deal because you begged me for a chance~\nIn addition to being a thief, are you also a liar as well? Hm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_29@Sob... It's not like that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_3@Watch out! Stay low!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_30@Sob, sob~~ Mommy~ Where are you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_31@A kid...? Is he lost?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_32@The strategy for the next game will be like this... Listen carefully...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_33@I have something urgent to do! I'll be right back!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_34@Hey! Wait a second!\nIf you're absent, our team won't have enough players to compete!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_35@Tsk... She really ran away... It must be something urgent...\nBut it looks like it's raining outside... Will she be alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_37@Where is he?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_38@Sob~ Sob~ Mommy~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_39@On the road! Wait for me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_4@Thank... thank you! Sis Akane!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_40@Don't worry. Did you get lost from your mommy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_42@It's too dangerous here. Let's cross the road first.\nLet's wait here on the sidewalk for your mother. Is that ok?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_44@Phew~ Good thing we can just wait here...\nWhen I saw you crying on the road alone, I was really scared...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_45@Big sister... Thank you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_46@Hehe~ You're welcome... It's my duty to grant everybody's wish.\nLet alone, a wish from a crying kid...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_47@It's so cold... and raining...\nBut I can't conjure warm clothes for you... I'm so sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_48@If this is your wish...\nI'll grant it for you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_49@...?! Coach...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_5@Be careful! Squirt Gun Competitions are just like war!\nOpen your eyes and focus your concentration, so that you can survive on the battlefield!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_50@How dare you run out while I was in the middle of a speech...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_51@Sob... I'm sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_52@I knew it must be urgent and important...\nSo I grabbed an umbrella and sweater and followed you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_53@Then... what about the game?\nBecause of me... the game was...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_54@Hehe~ It's just one game. It's okay... I'll just apologize to the league.\nI can't just sit and watch something bad happen to my members.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_55@Thank you... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_56@Anytime. Since you're my...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_57@Oh... Is he co-con... confess...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_58@You're a key member to keep the number of our members enough for squirt gun competitions...\nThere's still one month. You have to be healthy till they come back!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_59@Yes... Yes, sir...\nI knew it... Sob, sob~~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_7@I... the Christmas messenger, a noble being who grants everyone's dreams... should be the center of adoration and surrounded by children's laughter...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_3_8@But why am I here in this Squirt Gun Competition...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_1@Finally... we've made it past the understaffed month!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_10@But all of this is water under the bridge... I finally granted Coach's wish...\nI can finally have my antler back! I can finally go home... Sob...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_11@Miyuki, you did a nice job. During this month, you were really helpful.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_12@Miss Akane...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_13@It's true~ Were it not for Miyuki, we wouldn't have made it through this season!\nThank you, Miyuki!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_14@Miss Yui...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_15@Thank you~ Miyuki!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_16@Sob... Thank you... I was still helpful, wasn't I?\nI still contributed something to the team, didn't I... Sob~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_17@Miyuki, you did a wonderful job. I was really too mean to you...\nAt first, I was just having fun bullying you... but after seeing how much you have done for us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_18@Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_19@I really owe you a "Sorry" and "Well done" for this month...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_2@Hehe~ The main members have made it back against all odds!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_20@It's okay... I was originally sent by Old Man Claus here to grant your wishes anyways...\nIt's just something went wrong along the way...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_21@Old Man Claus...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_22@Ah~ Forget it. Where's my antler? We had a deal... You'll give it back to me, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_23@Ah... That thing... I thought it was a toy so I threw it away...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_24@...Huh?\nWhaaaaaaaat~~~~?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_25@All... all the misery that I went through... all for nothing...\nIt was indeed just a toy... That's right... You can throw it wherever you want... Haha... Hahahaha...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_26@I didn't throw it away! I was joking around... Even now I still find bullying you really fun... I'm so sorry!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_27@Coach... Sob... You're really mean... I'll never forgive you after I go back! Sob... I'll ask Old Man Claus not to deliver any present to your house anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_28@The antler... is shining?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_29@My antler is finally fixed. It seems to be even more powerful from everyone's gratitude... Terrific...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_3@How rude... I was just attending my father's combat camp...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_30@Miyuki... So you're really a messenger of Santa Claus?\nI always thought you were just joking...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_31@I never joke around! Humph!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_32@So that means... it is also true that... you promised to grant me three wishes?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_33@Of course... Now that you've used one wish, you still have two.\nBut I think I'll grant them next time we meet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_34@I'm going home. Thank you so much for everything during this month...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_35@Goodbye, Miyuki~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_36@Thank you for the present~ Miyuki~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_37@Hope we can see each other again, Miyuki~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_38@We will. Maybe we can meet again next year. Stop calling me a thief again then~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_39@Ah, she's really gone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_4@I had no choice but to go back and check my village since something happened... Master, please forgive me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_40@Coach... You didn't say goodbye to her in the end...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_41@Ah...Ahhh... I'm kinda freaked out...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_42@Damn... I still have two wishes available...\nIt's really a waste for someone so obedient like her to leave...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_43@What's more, she has regained her abilities. Hopefuly she can stay with me forever and serve me.\nIf so, both the power of my squirt gun team and my living quality should be enhanced significantly...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_44@Your wish... will be granted by me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_46@Ahh?... Should... Shouldn't I be back at Old Man Claus's?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_47@Could it be that... my murmur was counted as a wish, too?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_48@Aaaaaaahh~ Coach!! What kind of wish did you just make?!\nSob~~ I don't want this~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_49@I just want to go home~~~ Sob~~ Why are you always bullying me?!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_5@Same here... My management company suddenly arranged so many events for me...\nThey even established a new group and asked me to help... So~ I'm sorry~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_6@Phew... I've finally... made it through this month...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_7@I was so miserable this month, humiliated by opponents, scolded by Coach... Pheeew~ I'm finally over it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_8@Every time that I thought I finally familiarized with the squirt gun techniques, I would get wrecked by the opponents...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_4_9@Sigh... If I hadn't turned off all the alarms in the dormitory, I wouldn't be treated as a thief...\nAnd I wouldn't have lost my antler and powers, unable to return home...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_1@Even though our team has several sponsors, we still have to avoid excess expenses.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_10@Damn...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_12@Aah── Why do I have to do this?! All these shopping lists are way too long!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_13@Uhh... I want to sleep so much. Can't I skip the cleaning job...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_14@Is someone making a wish? My job is to carry out people's wishes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_15@Yes! Miyuki is here! I'm making a wish here! I wish──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_16@No! Way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_17@Woah... player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_18@Sigh. I've made the right decision to come here because of worry. Your punishments are for the better of our team. If Miyuki really has to break the rule...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_19@Then I'll have to keep your antler since that's the source of your power.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_2@And to cultivate the members' sense of responsibility, I decide to give chores to people who cause extra expenses last month.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_20@No! Please don't! Miyuki will not grant their wishes! Don't take away Miyuki's horn again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_21@Hehehe. Then that's good. I wish Miyuki will always behave~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_22@Mi-Miyuki will grant your wish... sob...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_23@player... is a devil...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_24@I agree...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_5@Tomoka, your constant being late for training has made our training time separate, and thus increased the number on our water and electricity bill. This month you'll be cleaning the training room so that we don't have to pay someone to do it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_6@Ugguhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_7@Rina, you play pranks on others too much. Mediating the arguments among you and other teammates has taken so much of my time that the time for training is shortened. You'll be running errands for other members to fix your relationship with them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_8@What? No! You're just taking revenge on me for personal things!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_1_9@No is not an acceptable answer. I'm still the coach of the team, so you'll be taking this job without rejecting it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_1@After Miyuki's identity as a Christmas messenger was exposed, I didn't change how I treated her so much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_10@So that means... Miyuki has to do it from the beginning...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_11@Good, you understand what I meant. Now the clock is ticking. Chop, chop!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_13@To marinate the chicken, I'll have to chop the garlic... Sob... It smells so bad...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_14@And then, cover the baking tray with foil...\nYahh! Why did it break again? It's the third broken foil...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_15@It's finally done. Now I can put it in the oven... Eh? What?! I can't open the oven! Is it broken?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_16@I'm also surprised to see how Miyuki buzz around in the afternoon yet fail at the last moment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_17@You've gotta be kidding me... What a coincidence...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_18@... I quit...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_19@Uh? Miyuki?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_2@... Instead, I should say, since teasing her is way too fun for me to stop it because of her identity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_20@Waah! Miyuki quits! I could have made one with my magic right away, but you, but you... Why do you keep picking on me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_21@Miyuki is so upset about all the frustrations that she has gotten that she is frowning badly.\nI pull her into my arms right away and pat her on her head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_22@There, there. It's all my fault. I won't pick on you again. Is that okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_23@Miyuki is not a kid...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_24@Even though she says so, Miyuki still stays in my arms and grabs the corner of my clothes, with an expression that shows how much she enjoys being patted like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_25@(Sigh... Why is she so cute... That makes me want to tease her more.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_3@Miyuki~ I want to eat roasted chicken~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_4@Ugh, if that's your wish...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_5@Stop! I don't want to eat roasted chicken without emotion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_6@Eh? Miyuki doesn't understand what you're saying...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_7@The power of a Christmas messenger can conveniently make a roasted chicken pop out. But making roasted chicken that way is just not sincere at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_8@The best about roast chicken is seeing the white chicken skin turning golden and crispy in the oven, and the sweet juices dripping from the chicken...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P019_N_2_9@Roast chicken is not roast chicken anymore when it's not made with the best chicken picked in person, marinated in person, and put into the oven in person by someone!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_1@On a certain night, Yui visits me mysteriously during the night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_10@According to Yui, she originally wanted to challenge herself with trying a sexy image, but the contents of her livestream have gotten more intense because of her fans’ requests.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_11@Although I know it isn't good, I want to make my fans’ wish come true, so please help me one more time! You're the only one I can ask for help, coach! —Yui’s troubled look is vivid in my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_12@However, Yui seems like a completely different person right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_13@We agreed that I’ll be using all of my toys this time... And... I’ve found a male friend to help me out this time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_14@The remote is in his hands and I have no control at all, so maybe I’ll be climaxing involuntarily again and again soon...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_15@What do you mean by involuntary... You’re obviously feeling really excited!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_17@Wait! Don’t turn it on suddenly...! I haven’t finished yet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_18@Should I stop? But the audience is very excited right now and the number of your viewers is growing like crazy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_19@R...Really!? In that case...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_2@Yui? Is something wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_20@Hearing what I said, Yui does her best to bear it, just as I expected.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_21@It’s because of my personality that does whatever people want that I’m in my current position. I guess this is what they mean by you reap what you sow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_22@*Click*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_23@I press a button on the remote to increase the vibration intensity, which makes Yui tremble in the screen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_24@No, no, no... If it’s any stronger than this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_25@The sound of the vibrating motor and Yui’s moans fill the mic and is transmitted to all sorts of unknown people on the Internet along with her shameful appearance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_26@Comments pile up on the message board in the screen. I bet all these guys are jerking off to Yui’s erotic look right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_27@But I’m the only one who can feel Yui’s gradually increasing body temperature and her female pheromones.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_28@Yes!!! Aaahhhh... Aahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_29@Yui’s face is flushed red and her eyes have lost focus as she trembles uncontrollably.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_3@Coach... Um... Can you help me with something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_30@She must be getting close to cumming. Other people might not know, but I’m very sure of this. At times like these, Yui loves it when I do this—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_31@*Click* *Click*
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_33@Yui moans shrilly as she climaxes immediately.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_35@Yui lies weakly in front of the screen with a lost expression on her face. The audience writes a stream of all sorts of embarrassing comments that fill the screen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_36@“What a fierce orgasm!” “Look at her expression! She must have squirted!” “I’m so hard right now...” “The guy over there should fuck her right now!”
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_37@Fuck her right now... What a good suggestion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_38@I approach Yui and press my erect cock against her pussy. Yui awakens from her stupor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_39@Ah! Wait... You don’t need to do this—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_40@She tries to stop me anxiously, but her wet pussy welcomes me, drawing my cock in all the way to the base.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_41@Ahhh—You’ve put it in me... You liar! You shouldn’t do this during my livestream...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_42@But this is what the fans want. Shouldn’t I try harder?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_43@No... If you fill me up with your cock, I’ll forget about everything else...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_44@Yui struggles, but her sounds of resistance become moans after my cock slides in and out of her a few times.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_45@No... It feels so good... Everyone can see your cock filling my pussy again and again... But I can't stop...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_46@“Whoa! Is this for real? They're doing it live?” “They're doing it raw!” “Amazing...”
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_47@The comments section flashes like crazy as a stream of comments flood in. I think I'm starting to understand why Yui is addicted to this. We can't let down all of our fans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_48@IYU, look, everyone is getting high watching us. So... Let’s make things more steamy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_49@I start thrusting harder into her and I bet the mic can catch all of the sounds we make.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_5@[IYU’s stream has started]
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_50@Suddenly, I flip the vibrator to the max settings.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_52@Yui moans loudly and her body arches, but no matter how she struggles, she can’t stop the pleasure assaulting her from all over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_54@She has become a slave to her pleasure and can’t do anything else right now. Her intoxicated look fills the screen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_55@This is amazing... Her nipples and clit are erect and her pussy is clenching tight... So this is what Yui likes? What do you like the most?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_56@Aaahhh... Cock... Cock... Cock... Cock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_57@So you love cock the most? Then let’s make your pussy cum with cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_58@I don’t give Yui any chance to breath before I start thrusting even harder. The comments on the screen refresh like crazy as new comments pile up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_59@“Cum in her!” “Cum in her!” “Cum in her!” “I really want to see her cum!” “Cum already!”
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_6@Is the connection all right? Is the sound clear? That’s great...! Hi, everyone, I'm IYU.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_60@Look, Yui, this is what the audience wants!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_62@Yui’s body trembles as she orgasms and I shoot my load deep inside her at this time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_63@Her pussy clenches tight and spasms like it wants to shoots out cum too. I shoot load after load inside Yui until it overflows from her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_65@Yui cums so powerfully that she is no longer conscious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_66@I position the camera so that it takes a close-up of her pussy, which makes the audience write comments like crazy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_67@“Whoa! He really came inside her!” “This shit is crazy...” “I bet this’ll make her pregnant.” “I confirm that she’s getting pregnant”
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_68@“I’m so happy! Thanks for the show!” “She's definitely getting pregnant!” “I’ve made a backup of this already” “Eh? Why are they stopping?”
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_69@[We are sorry, but the IYU livestream you were watching has been locked]
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_7@I’m standing in front of the camera, looking at Yui livestreaming herself. I never expected Yui to do something like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_8@Okay... Well, what do you all think of my look today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P02_h3_9@Yui is almost stark naked. Numerous sex toys are hanging from her body, and she's even wearing a mask to conceal her identity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_1@It's midnight right now, so I'll have to finish the summon in three minutes...\nplayer, keep your eyes on the candle for me. Make sure it doesn't go out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_10@About the candle...\nHmm... I've got a great idea~ Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_12@Aaaaahhh~ The candle~~!\nNo~~ I-It's not supposed to go out~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_14@Waaaaaah~ Coach! What have you done??!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_15@I... I didn't mean to... it just went out all of a sudden...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_16@Hurry up!... Light it again!\nAaaah~ The time... Can I still make it in time?! I'll have to summon it right at twelve o' three!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_17@Okay! It's done! Alice, you can keep going now~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_19@Tinkle~! Tinkle~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_2@Alice... Look... Can you stop being such a weeb...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_20@It really wasn't me this time... I really didn't do anything!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_21@Waaaah~ The timing... The perfect timing has passed...\nDarn it~ I'll do it anyways!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_22@Thou built thy frontier in the Midland Abyss... I shall open the depths of the dreamscape, and summon thou from the abyss...\nMy spell has entangled itself around thy abyssal body... Follow my summons and reveal thyself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_24@Really now... Alice, nothing happened~\nJust like I said... this is the real world...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_25@What a beautiful moon...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_26@What... W-Who are you...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_27@Grace the Dream Succubus has followed thy summon... coming from the abyss of dreams and desire...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_28@Hey... Hey... Alice... Alice... Did... did you really succeed?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_29@Ohoho~ So the owner of this spiritual energy is called Alice?\nEven though I don't really like female spiritual energy, it's still not a bad appetizer~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_3@Thou built thy frontier in the Midland Abyss... I shall open the depths of the dreamscape, and summon thou from the abyss...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_30@Alice fainted? Did this female devil with horns on her head really suck up all of Alice's spiritual energy...?\nCrap... That means there's no one left to control this devil right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_31@Ohoho~ Thou... looketh pretty nervous~\nLet me take a closer look at thee...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_32@Aaah~ What a masculine smell and overflowing spiritual energy...\nMaybe thou can serve as a nice main dish...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_33@Oh no... My body... Why can't I move my body...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_34@To answer her summons, I was forced to pass through the abyssal gates... which has severely drained my powers...\nTo make it up to me, thou... shall satisfy my every need... Hehehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_35@Crap... Is it... Is it coming?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_37@Aah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_38@Wha-what happened? Why did this devil suddenly faint?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_39@After touching thy body... all of my power was transferred to thee... How did this happen...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_4@Just wake up, Alice... Stop letting your imagination run wild...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_40@Do... do you mean... Ah, I... I suddenly feel so powerful...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_41@No... Don't come closer... If thou come any closer... I might not be able to take it...\nAhh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_42@She fainted again... What on earth is going on...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_5@Really now... could you focus here? I must perform the summon at the right time. If the summon isn't completed at the perfect timing, words won't be able to describe the severity of the consequences!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_6@This time, I'm going to summon the devil of dreams... It's rumored that if you can successfully summon her, you'll be able to command her to manipulate everyone's dreams...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_7@Alright... fine~ I'll keep watch on the candle... Just make it quick...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_8@Sigh... This weeb really can't seem to ever learn...\nI'll have to do something to teach her a lesson...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_1_9@Okay... I'm going to begin the summoning ritual again!\nplayer! Don't let the candle go out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_1@Something must be wrong... I'm a succubus who sucks spiritual energy from men...\nWhy would I ever lose all of my power by touching a man...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_10@Anyways, I'll start from this girl!\nThis is a test for how much power remains in me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_11@Aah~ Which pose should I use to seduce Coach today?\nSince Coach is so different today, Miyu can only think about the sweet date later with him right now~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_12@Good day~ Cute little girl...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_13@Ah... You are...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_14@That's right... Fear me...\nI'm the controller of the desire abyss, the devourer of your soul...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_15@You're the familiar Alice summoned!\nAlice is amazing! I didn't expect her to really summon a devil!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_17@Ms. Devil, may I touch the horns on your head? They look so cool!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_18@Kids in this world are just so rude. Don't they know that they should respect me, a devil...?\nSeems like I'm really underestimated here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_19@Miss...? Are you alright? Why are you trembling?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_2@This is ridiculous!\nWhat would the others think of me if they found out about this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_20@Thy sipritual energy... Thy excess energy... I'll take it all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_21@Mi-miyu's body...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_22@Ahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_23@Ohehe, now you should know how scary I am... My power is still here in me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_24@Yes! It worked! Hehee!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_25@But... will it work against... that man?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_26@Worry not... There must have been some mistake last time. I'm a succubus that devours men's spiritual energy! There's no reason my spiritual energy should be sucked up like that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_28@Good... Now's the chance to catch him off guard! I won't fail this time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_29@Grace...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_3@No! I have to regain control of the situation!\nI must engrave how scary a demon I am deep in everyone's heart!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_30@Thy masculine spiritual energy! I desire it! I won't hold back this time!\nI'm going to suck out everything to the last drop of thy blood!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_32@Ahh... I feel so powerless...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_33@I... can't...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_34@Sigh... It might be because of my imperfect summoning ritual...\nI've finally successfully summoned a devil... but it's unbelievably useless...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_35@Who... who dost thou think thou are talking to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_36@Of course I was talking about you, the useless devil...\nIf you still have any doubt... player, go touch anywhere on her body again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_37@No... Don't come any closer... Please... My power has been sucked up by thee...\nIf thou come and touch me again... Aaaaaahh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_38@Sigh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_5@Hehe~ Coach was so passionate today when he asked me to go shopping with him.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_6@For some reason, I feel that Coach is more energetic than usual~\nWhenever I saw him today, my heart would beat out of control... How bothersome...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_7@Hmm~ Maybe when we go out shopping together, Miyu can pretend to feel ill and ask Coach to rest together in a hotel down the street... Hehehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_8@Humph... As expected...\nI'm still sensitive to strong spiritual energy in someone longing for sex...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_2_9@I must say, the spiritual energy in this girl is off the charts...\nI've only seen this kind of situation on men infatuated with me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_1@The opponents are split now! What do we do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_10@Yes...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_11@Good job! You've gathered the enemies together!\nAnd now it's time for that~~! Spiteful Curse!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_12@E-eat this...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_13@Hehee~ Perfect! We won again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_15@Congratulations~ We won again!\nIf we tally the numbers, this should be an unprecedented twenty victory streak!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_16@Hehe~ It's all thanks to me~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_17@All thanks to our new member, Grace~\nGirls, let's give her a big hand~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_18@Tsk... She was summoned by ME!...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_19@Congratulations~ Miss Grace~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_2@Alright~~ Leave it to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_20@You... you're really good... But please don't touch me ever again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_21@Alright~ We should let bygones be bygones. Today is a day of celebration!\nIn anticipation of this day, I've even brought out my cherished wine I've kept for fifteen years!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_22@Ohh~ That's wonderful~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_23@Let's toast~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_24@Ugh... Why would a devil of the desire abyss like me end up like this... burp...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_25@That useless magician is to blame... She was the one who summoned me with that lousy ritual...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_26@Aaah~ Darn it~! I want to go back to Valkyria!\nNothing good has ever happened to me in this world...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_27@That coach is pretty good-looking though. And the masculine smell on him is just so irresistible. His spiritual energy must be more delicious than anything I've ever tasted...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_28@But if I can't taste it, it's nothing to me... Humph...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_29@Grace... What's the matter? Why are you here drinking alone looking upset?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_3@Go~! I Choose you, Grace~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_30@It's none of your business... I can drink however I want! Humph...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_31@Just look at how drunk you are. Today I learned that even a devil can get drunk...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_32@It has nothing to do with being a devil or not!\nHey... I'm warning you... Don't you dare take advantage of me while I'm drunk and touch me, sucking up all my power again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_33@I'm the de...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_35@Aaah... I touched... you again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_36@But... I'm fine...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_37@Wait... This feeling...?!\nSpiritual energy... is streaming into my body nonstop...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_38@Ah~ What a pleasant feeling... \nThis smell... this flavor... You taste just like how I have always imagined!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_39@Gr-grace... I... I can't... anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_40@What do you mean you can't?! Man up and try to last longer\nI... I haven't had enough of you yet! Hehehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_42@Oh... No... Not again... Why is my power being drained again... and when I was just about to cum...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_43@Gra-grace... Your body... It's so warm... and sweet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_44@P-please... Stop it... Aah~ I... I'm going to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_45@Hey... Is everything alright inside? Are they doing something dirty in there?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_46@But... The only their fingers are touching...\nWhy are they lying there limp on the floor, writhing with pleasure written all over their faces...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_5@Why should I, the devil of the desire abyss, listen to thy order...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_6@Grace...?! Don't space out~\nOr I'll call time out and ask Coach to come and...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_8@Al-alright... Please don't bring Mr. player here... Please...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_3_9@Then cast that for me! Desire Abyss!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_1@Ugh... Where am I...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_10@But I came first... player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_11@A-alice...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_12@Fine... H-how about this...!\nWe can do it together...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_13@Senpai... How could you do this to me...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_14@Ya-yandere Chan...! It's... it's not like that!\nI can explain!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_15@My dear Coach... Didn't you promise me to complete my mission together?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_16@What... Why is Nemesis also here..?\nWait... Hold on... Don't just start a fight like that here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_17@Hehe~ Senpai... I mean...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_18@If you're doing this together... Why didn't you include me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_19@I... Dear Coach... I can be helpful too...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_2@player~ Do you want to do something pleasing... together?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_20@Nemesis... you... I don't need any more help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_21@No! It's impossible!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_22@This is just ridiculous! This can't be real life!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_24@... This... This is...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_25@Ohehe... You've finally noticed...\nI bet you were loath to admit the fact that this wasn't reality.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_26@Gra-grace?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_27@Because of that thing from this world... Ohehe~\nBecause of that little drink... my world has been transferred to this one...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_28@Wait... You must be wasted... None of your words make any sense...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_29@I'm not! I'm completely sober...\nOhehe~ I just... I just drank a little~ Darn~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_3@What... Why are you acting like that all of a sudden...? Alice, did you accidentally take some strange pill again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_30@Humph~ It's my first time to know that... I can manipulate my power like this after drinking wine...\nLast time after I drank it... I felt instantly better... no... I mean so bad...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_31@Do... do you want to continue our talk after you're sober...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_32@Wait... So... am I in a dream...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_33@Yes~ It's a sweet dream weaved by me~ The devil of the desire abyss... Ohehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_34@Did you get... your powers back?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_35@With wine as the medium, I've regained my powers~ not completely though~\nSo I'm testing it by weaving this gorgeous wet dream...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_36@Seeing how... I only dare touch you... in dreams...\nAhh~ Even in dreams... i can taste your thick spiritual energy emanating into the air...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_37@My... my body...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_38@Ohehe~ Doesn't it feel great...? Are you feeling hot and bothered all over your body right now?\nDo you having the urge to... passionately embrace a woman...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_39@Come on... In dreams... you can become a beast controlled by lust...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_4@Hey~ player~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_40@And I... Ohehe~\nI hereby order you to... ravage me... in any way... to your heart's content...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_41@Of course... I'll also grant your wish... and pleasure you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_5@A-akane? Why are you also here...?\nCould you check Alice for me? She seems... well... a little...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_6@Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_7@You... Akane... Why are you taking your clothes off?...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_8@player~ It's been a while since the last time we...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_4_9@What... Here...?\nYou... you gotta be kidding... Here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_10@Why am I familiar with this kind of cliche... Grace?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_11@Hehe, you're pretty calm~ How long can you stay decent like that? Why don't you just fall with me...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_12@So! When are you going to sober up?!\nIt's an order! Control your outbreaking desire!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_13@In addition, on this kind of thing, I still want to be in the leading position!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_14@Oh! So that's how it is? I understand... Hehe...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_15@A black swirl appears and Miyuki comes out naked with a hand covering her private part.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_16@player... What kind of wish do you have now? I'll grant it no matter what kind of position you like...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_17@I'm not asking for this kind of leading position! Ahh── I should go to a pharmacy to buy you some medicine for sobering up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_18@Huhuu~ Don't you try to take away the power I finally regain~\nLet's see... see who loses first~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_3@... But I refuse!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_4@After shouting it out with all my strength, I run away ignoring Grace's surprised face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_5@Pant, pant... It should be safe in the laundry room. Damn, that was so shameful.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_6@No matter how tempting Grace's offer was, I still felt something weird from it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_7@Master, is there anything bothering you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_8@Woah! Itsuki! Why are you popping out from the laundry basket...? No, I mean, where are your clothes?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_1_9@Master, I'm so hot... So...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_1@Despite Grace's sabotage, I finally overcame all the obstacles, got the medicine, and fed it into the succubus's mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_10@What? You are finally accepting my invitation?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_11@You can't do anything to me right now, can you? If you dare touch me, all of your power might be drained.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_12@Tsk, if only I have liquor here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_13@I'll stop beating around the bush. Because of you, I'll have to take another day off so that I won't keep thinking about the nudes of my members. Do you know what it means?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_14@Oh? I guess it means that I'm affecting you very much? That's my pleasure~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_15@... I mean, one day of training is wasted because of you!\nAs compensation, you should use your power as a dream succubus.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_16@Enter other members' dreams and satisfy their desires... As long as they have a great dream, I think they can be more energetic when they get up. Then it can make up the wasted time for a little.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_17@Humph... Why should I obey your order?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_18@Do you want me to drain your power right now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_19@Ugh...! I... got it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_2@After that, the materialized wet dream was gone, and Grace got back to the status where she "would lose all her strength whenever she touched me."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_21@Me?! Am I the MVP? Finally... people have noticed me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_23@So many animals... So flurry... I'm so happy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_25@Humph... All of their desires are just so boring... How could I fall into such circumstance...\nDamned player... I'll give you the doubled shame you give me today in the future!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_26@And then, you'll have to kneel down before me, having no choice but to let me suck out your thick masculine spiritual energy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_3@The only problem remaining is that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_4@I kept seeing the over-exciting scenes of naked members that day, which makes it hard for me to face them right now... I'll have to take a day off to dump all those memories from my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_6@Great job, everyone. I have something else to do tomorrow, so I'll make tomorrow a day off for all of you. Please take a good rest~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_7@Grace, you stay here. I've got something to say to you. Others may leave now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P020_N_2_8@Oh~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_1@Bang!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_10@Don't scare me suddenly jumping out like that... \nDo you need anything?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_11@Sorry if I scared you. Well...\nThere's a friend of mine... She's on a holiday now, so she is hoping to find something to do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_12@So...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_13@Is it possible to allow her to join our training and competitions?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_14@Holidy, huh... So that means she'll only be a temporary member... how should I arrange her on the team...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_15@She has far greater shooting skill and physical prowess than me... Please... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_16@O-Okay... Fine... Since it's you who's asking, how could I refuse.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_17@Thank you, Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_19@Yawn~ What a fresh morning! Why don't I make some breakfast for the girls...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_2@Coach! I hit it... Did you see that?\nYay!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_20@Hey! What's wrong with everyone here?\nDo you all wake up so late?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_21@Uh... Who's this exhibitionist...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_22@It's none of your business how I dress! Report your rank, soldier!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_23@I... I am...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_24@Give me a report on the surrounding environment and more information about this place!\nMake it quick! I don't have all day to waste time on a maggot like you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_25@Ma-maggot?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_26@Huh... what? Did I insult your worthless dignity?\nIn my eyes, that's exactly what you are, a useless maggot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_27@You...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_28@If you want my recognition, you'll have to show me your value!\nGot it? Give me! Your Report! Right! Now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_29@What are you staring at me all bug-eyed for? Where's my report?\nDo you even know how to give one?! Or do you need my instruction? Hurry your ass up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_3@Yes. I saw you hit the bullseye perfectly.\nYou've really improved a lot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_30@Co-Coach! Sorry I overslept... \nDiana! He's the coach! Don't command him like you would in the military!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_31@Humph, so this is the guy that you've constantly been talking about?\nI thought he would be more impressive! I didn't expect him to be a coward that can't even respond to a woman's taunts!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_32@Riria... Is she the friend on holiday you mentioned?\nYou may ask her to leave now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_33@Sorry... Coach, Diana is the captain of a fleet...\nShe just needs some time to get used to her new identity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_34@Captain of a fleet...? A captain wearing... this... How does she even command...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_35@Humph, you're just like all the men out there, judging my ability based on what I'm wearing! Maggot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_36@Sorry, Coach... I'll try talking to her... \nDiana! I've told you countless times! You can't just be calling everyone a maggot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_37@At least just call them trash or chicken. Maggot is way too mean...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_38@Uh... What on earth did you learn in the army...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_4@It's all thanks to your instruction, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_5@Don't sweat it. It's what a Coach does.\nAlright, it's getting a bit late... You should go and rest up for the physical training tomorrow morning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_6@No problem... I'll be going now. Thank you, Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_7@Hehe... What an innocent and adorable girl.\nOkay... I should also go to bed now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_1_9@Ohohoh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_1@Ana... Didn't you agree to keep your temper in check here?\nThis dormitory isn't a military base, so you really can't talk and act like you do in the army...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_10@Hehe~ It's nothing to be ashamed of.\nIsn't pleasing women the only function of men?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_11@Ana! It's not like that!\nYou don't know player's strengths... He's not your average man!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_12@Oh~ It's rare for you to like a man so much, Ria... \nAlright, I'll treat him with a little more respect for now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_13@Hehe... Seems like this is a man worthy for me to try out...\nMaybe he isn't an useless piece of trash, but an intersting toy that's slightly better...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_14@In addition... Ria has her heart set on him. Hehe~ player... You've aroused my curiousity.\nI want anything that Ria has, and I'll steal it from her if that's what it takes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_16@Alright~! That concludes our competitive training for today. Girls, you may go rest now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_17@Riria, you did a great job as well today. I'm looking forward to your performance in the next match!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_18@Thank you, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_19@As for your friend...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_2@Ria... how many times have I told you?! Men are an inferior race that needs to be suppressed with your authority and insullts for them to show you respect!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_20@Ana...? Is there anything wrong with her?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_21@Uh... Even though I didn't see her dodging much during the game, her clothes still remained dry... \nIt's like she never got hit from the beginning to the end...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_22@Ana is really strong... You can tell from how she made captain at such a young age. \nShe's a strategic genius, but is also naturally gifted in physical and judement-making abilities.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_23@However, she is also naturally gifted in having a bad personality...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_24@Ehehehe...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_25@Hey~ Maggot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_26@Wha-what...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_27@I don't think the competitive training was enough for me. If you have time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_28@I'd like you to conduct real competitive training with me... \none‧on‧one♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_3@Common sense in the military doesn't translate to the outside world, Ana...\nIn addition, player isn't someone like that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_4@Ria... when it comes to physical prowess and combat skills, you're second to none. Why do you choose to bury your talent and follow the orders from this inferior man?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_5@That's because... player is a gentleman. No matter who you are, as long as you're a member of his team, he will kindly take good care of you and cherish you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_6@Hey hey hey~ Ria, have you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_7@What's more, of all the men I've met, he possesses the best skill and stamina...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_8@Wait... Have you... done it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_2_9@Ana! What are you talking about! \nI was just talking about player's skill and stamina in training... We... We...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_1@You are really... the best toy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_10@She really almost messed me up... Sigh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_11@Ana's father and my father have been friends since they worked together in the military police, which makes us friends since we were little. That's why I know her so well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_12@Due to Ana's father being a high ranking officer, she barely had any friends to have heart-to-heart talks. I was the only person that she could open her heart to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_13@We once made a promise to always be there when the other person felt lonely, and to always share our happiness and things we cherish with each other. What's mine is hers, and vice versa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_14@Ana grew up surrounded by a bunch of powerful men. She really worked very hard to earn their recognition... since in the military, one's rank and ability are what's most important.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_15@Without the ability to back you up, no matter how high your rank is, it's still hard to persuade and command soldiers beneath you... \nThat's why Ana looks down on men so much, as she believes that only authority and strength can command respect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_16@I... I know exactly what you're talking about... She was always the one in charge and taking the initiative... I wasn't allowed to take control at all...\nWhenever I tried to lead, she would use her body and strength to take back control...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_17@So... how was her training? Was Coach satisfied with her combat and shooting ability?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_18@Uh... So you were talking about... actual training?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_19@Hmm? That's what I was talking about all along... She usually includes unarmed combat; shooting; strategy analysis; and something she's best at, movement prediction; in her training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_20@Was she not following this training plan...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_21@Aha~ So that's where my little toy ran off to~! \nDidn't I say I would give you plenty of love after I rested a bit?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_22@I never expected you to run off without my permission... \nHow dare you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_23@Get on the bed! Right! Now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_24@A-ana?\nWhy... why did you come out from Coach's room?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_25@I... I suddenly remember that I have a captain meeting later... So... I... I should be going now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_26@Dang it... I let him get away... \nHehe~ Where is that indomitable spirit of his now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_27@Ana... Ana... You two were... training together... right? Please tell me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_28@Ria, we've always shared everything since we were little, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_29@... That's right...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_3@I guess I can't call you a maggot anymore, since you really are the best man I've ever used... \nBut I'm pretty tired right now. i'll give you plenty of loving later!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_30@What's yours is mine. \nI will always share what belongs to me too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_31@So... there's no exception now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_32@You... You two...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_33@I think I kinda agree with what you said. I have changed my view about player a little... \nHe's not a useless piece of garbage but a really fun toy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_34@Sorry~ Ria... but your boyfriend is such a good lay. I think I'm gonna keep playing with him.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_35@Ria... How could you do this to me...!\nI... I came here first!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_36@The holiday you arranged for me was really wonderful.\nThank you, my best friend.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_4@That arrogant woman... is finally tired...\nI should sneak out right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_5@Phew... I thought I would die on the bed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_6@player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_8@You... you scared me...\nOh, it's Riria... What's up? Why aren't you sleeping yet? It's alrerady so late...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_3_9@I... was a liittle worried about your training with Ana...\nShe always becomes excessively strict when she gets serious...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_1@Today... is the last day, right...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_10@Hehe~ Thanks for reminding me. I'll definitely figure it out, but just not right now~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_11@I feel like I'm caught in a... battlefield...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_12@So!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_13@...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_14@Ana! Are you taking your leave now or not?\nIf you stay for any longer, all of us will start feeling unhappy again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_16@Sigh... So even you hate me and want me to go...\nThose words we said to each other before... to be best friends forever, and to share what we have with each other...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_17@None of what you said... was true... huh?\nHumph, I see that I'm still just as lonely as before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_18@Ana...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_19@I reached out for your help before the holiday and you arranged everything for me...\nNobody cared about me as much as you did...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_2@Hehe~ In the past seven days, you've been a pretty nice toy. Of all the men I've toyed with, you're the only one that hasn't been broken by me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_21@Farewell... After boarding today, it should be a very long time till the next time we meet.\nHope you can be happier after I leave...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_22@Ana~ Don't go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_23@I really had a great time here. Thank you for everything you've arranged for me... Ria.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_25@Riria... she left already...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_26@I know... but I still feel so sorry...\nWe promised to share everything we have with each other... but I still...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_27@It might be years before I see her again...\nI really regret saying all those mean things to her... I'm so sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_28@One week later
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_29@Ria! I'm here to chill again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_3@Not to mention your stubborn face and unyielding character... They really pushed my sadistic desire to a climax. The seven days here were definitely the most relaxing holiday I've ever had.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_31@Yo! My toy! I place myself in your care once more!\nI've come up with some new sadistic ideas, so be sure to satisfy me properly! Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_32@A-ana~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_33@Yo~ Ria~ I didn't expect us to meet again so soon... Well... How should I put it...\nThe long deployment seemed to be fake orders~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_34@Go...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_35@Hm? Ria? You don't look so good. What's wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_36@Go back to your vessel right now!\nAnd give me back all my tears and regret! Ana~~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_4@Is... is that so...?\nThis is the first time I can't seem to be happy from a girl's compliment though...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_5@Ana... The car to pick you up has been waiting for a while. You should get going now. \nAll of your crewmates are waiting for you onboard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_6@Oh? They're used to waiting for me, so I never have to worry about being late.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_7@Ana, if I remember correctly, I heard my father say that you have a long deployment for the following week. It wouldn't be good if the plan ends up being cancelled because you were late for boarding...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_8@How interesting, Ria. From whom did you father hear this confidential information?\nIf that person is found leaking military information, he'll really find himself in deep trouble~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_4_9@So~ why don't you go back and check if the information was leaked by any of your crew members?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_1@Bang! Bang!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_10@Do you think people possess power when they're born? Let me tell you. Everything I have, from my physical ability, my skill, to my attitude, is accumulated little by little in the army! That's a part of my strength!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_11@If you can't understand anything, you shall just be a toy then~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_12@No matter how crazily and haughtily she laughed, I'm not getting angry.\nBecause... she is right.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_13@Just like how athletes' great performances are based on their daily training, I can't deny how splendid her result of training is, though I still consider her training environment not so healthy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_14@So that means only the strong ones get to talk. Got it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_15@I take the target off from a robot and wave it at Diana.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_16@I'll be the target from now. Just try if you can hit me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_17@Ha, interesting! How dare you taunt me like that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_18@You're really a nice toy! Bring it on and start moving!\nKeep running! Keep pleasing me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_2@The robots for training move swiftly with targets on them around the court, but are all shot down by Diana without any miss.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_3@Your physical ability is still terrifyingly good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_4@Humph, artificial things are just seconds of the seconds. Lame.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_5@Oh, right. How about... toy, you come here and be my target? This way, I'll be more motivated.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_6@Diana points her gun at me.\nI should be mad, but another emotion appears in my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_7@... I don't get it. You can wreck so many people with only your skill. Why do you still have to maintain your position by belittling men?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_8@I asked the question because I was really confused, but Diana, who looks like she has heard something funny, raises her head and laughs loudly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_1_9@Hahahaha! Toys are toys for a reason!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_1@During the break, I walk into the living room and see Diana playing with her leather whip with a bored face.\nFrom the other side, Kana walks out of the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_10@That's why it matches perfectly with the scented tea. Here you are~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_11@Diana takes over the cup of tea from Kana. After she takes a sip of it, an expression of satisfaction flashes in her eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_12@I'll admit you really have a great skill combining different kinds of food together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_13@Now you may spit it out. What do you want from me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_15@You're trying to please me by making cookies and this cup of tea, aren't you? So you must want something from me.\nSince you did please me, I can satisfy you as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_16@(Sigh... This woman is just full of herself. It's time for me to save this awkwardness──)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_17@Just when I want to walk into the living room, I see Kana smiling sweetly at Diana.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_18@If there's something I want from Miss Diana... I want to see your smile.\nI will be satisfied if people can feel happy eating the food I make.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_19@Ah, the cookies in the oven are done. I'll go take them out~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_2@Miss Diana~ I just made some cookies. Wanna try some?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_21@... Innocent girl. I guess she has been protected very well in her life. Should I consider it fortunate or unfortunate?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_22@Toy, how long do you want to keep hiding there? Do you really think you're fit enough to hide there?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_23@So you have found me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_24@By the way, don't you think you're treating Kana and me too differently?! Could you at least treat me as a human?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_25@Ha. Didn't you get enough sleep last night?\nToys will always be toys. And you should already be grateful that I'm not calling you a maggot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_26@Well, thanks a lot then!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_3@Oh, just put it there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_4@And I also made some scented tea. Wait a minute. I'll bring it here, too~ 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_6@Diana doesn't notice me here at all.\nAfter a while, she finally throws her leather whip away and picks up a cookie randomly from the plate.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_7@It's boring as hell. I'll go find myself some fun... Hm? This is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_8@With her eyebrow raised, Diana keeps throwing the cookies into her mouth one after another.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P021_N_2_9@It tastes pretty good, just a little too sweet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_1@Meowrrr... The last couple of days have been so cold...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_10@Meowr meowrr... There's too much that I don't understand...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_11@Hmm? Why'd you stop eating? Are you thinking about something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_12@Little cats shouldn't have to worry too much about stuff~!\nYou just focus on being yourself~ and finish that taiyaki now~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_13@He's touching me again... Meowrrr...\nI don't know what he's saying, but somehow I feel like I'm being looked down upon...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_14@Alright, kitty cat, I'm going back now.\nSee you tomorrow~ Finish up now, and I'll bring more for you tomorrow. Bye bye~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_15@From that day on... the person never showed up again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_16@Meowrr... He still hasn't come back today...\nI kind of... miss him...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_18@Meowr~! W-Who's that! Meooowrr~~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_2@Ahh... It's him!\nHe has a bag in his hand... Could it be?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_20@Hmm... I don't see the cat... I was really looking forward to it too...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_21@Coach threw out his back during training, but he told me that as long as I brought taiyaki, a cat would come rushing out to rub up against your leg and lick your hand with its prickly tongue...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_22@Ohh~~ I really want to pet the kitty~~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_23@Meow~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_24@Hmm?! I found you!\nYes! Good kitty~ Do you want some taiyaki?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_25@Meow~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_26@Ahhh~ Don't go... little pussy cat~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_27@Really now... Why am I the only one that isn't able to pet the cat...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_28@Meowrr~ This smell...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_29@I'm not ready to give up yet~ I will pet a cat today, no matter what!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_3@Hey~ You scared me little kitty, suddenly jumping out like that.\nWere you lying in wait for me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_30@Meowrr...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_31@Hmm...? This girl that suddenly appeared out of nowhere... is kind of cute...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_32@The cats that just ran into the bush are called Whiskers and Tiger...\nDo you... want me to call them to come out?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_33@Uh... That's what the cats are called?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_34@That's right~ I'm Luna. Our names were all given by that man...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_35@That man...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_36@Give me... that bag in your hand, and I'll help call out Whiskers and Tiger...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_37@I can't! Coach specifically told me that this was for the cats here. Taiyaki is their favorite food!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_39@Do you... really want some?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_4@Ahh... This person... smells so good... and warm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_41@F-Fine... but you can only have a bite!\nI still have to give the rest to the cats, or else Coach will have my hide...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_42@Here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_43@Meowrrr...\nYes! This is it! The familiar taste and texture! So this food is called taiyaki?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_44@S-Slow down! If you eat it all, how will I be able to coax the cats out?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_45@It's ok, leave it to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_46@Meowrr meow~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_48@What... they both came out?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_49@Come, Whiskers and Tiger~ This girl was sent by that man to bring us food, meowrr~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_5@Such a nice cute kitty~ You really love to snuggle up against me, don't you?\nYou must be curious as to what I have in my bag~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_50@She still has food on her! Eat to your heart's content!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_51@Meowrr~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_52@W-Wait a minute...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_54@I-I'm back...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_55@Thanks for the hardwork, Kana...\nI threw out my back and I haven't been able to get out of bed for a couple of days. I couldn't go feed the cats myself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_56@Did you help me feed them properly?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_57@I did... but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_58@Yes? And...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_59@Ahh! This is it! This is where that man lives!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_6@Here you go~ Have a taste~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_60@Y-You are...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_61@Meowrr~~! Where have you been?! I missed you so much!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_62@Ahhh~ Why are you jumping on me the instant we meet!\nWhat's wrong with this girl?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_7@Ahh~ This is what I wanted~ Such a sweet and savory taste~\nWhy didn't you just give me this from the beginning!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_8@Good kitty~ It seems that you really like to eat taiyaki.\nThat's wonderful~ Let's have some together!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_1_9@Mhmmm... Why is this person so nice to me?\nHe gives me stuff to eat everyday, and loves to get all handsy with me... I have to admit that it feels good though...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_1@Hmm... Purrr...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_10@Hmm... It seems to be the room of that girl called... Kana?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_11@There is always a citrus smell emanating from this girl... How revolting...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_12@She seems to be fast asleep... but the smell is still there...\nIs it coming from her open mouth?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_13@Mmph... Mmph...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_14@Yes! I plugged up her hole!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_15@Mhmmm! Pant~ Pant~ Pant~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_16@Meowwwarghhh~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_17@I... thought I was going to suffocate... Pant...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_18@Did I hear a cat's yowl just then...?\nI must be dreaming... Pets are forbidden in the dormitory...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_2@So... this is...? The man's home?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_20@Whew... that scared me. I only wanted to block the source of the smell... Humans love to freak out at the tiniest of things...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_21@This smell...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_22@Just as I thought! It's that man's smell... So I was brought here by him...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_23@Why do you treat me so well...? First feeding me and now giving me a comfortable place to sleep...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_24@Your smell is also so enticing... this milky smell...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_25@Hehehe~ Your pants are covered in my fur. Hmphh~ That means you are my property!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_26@Your clothes are still free of my smell and fur...\nI've decided! Today I'll be sleeping on top of you! Heh~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_28@S-So... heavy... can't breathe...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_29@Ahhh!!\nW-What's that on my chest?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_3@What a large house... but, wasn't I sleeping in a bush...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_30@Snore... Snore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_31@L-Luna? Why are you sleeping here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_32@Meowwr...? G-Good morning...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_33@Eh...? What's that smell?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_34@Meow?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_35@Why do you smell like... garbage...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_36@Meowr? Really? I don't smell anything, meowrr~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_37@Coach! Sob~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_38@What now?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_39@I woke up to my room full of garbage! It's so nasty and it smells... What do I do now~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_4@Aha~ Found it! A trash can!\nOhh! Wow, there are fish bones~ Omm nomm~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_40@Lunaaa~~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_41@It's not meeowr! Luna didn't go fishing in the trash can for fishbones!\nLuna also didn't leave a newfound toy as a present on your pillow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_42@You're talking about this dead rat, right...\nBy the way... how did you know there was something on my pillow?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_43@Eeek~~! Coach don't you dare come near me~ Ahhh~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_44@Eh? Do you not like Luna's gift?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_5@However... this trash can seems different than usual...?\nWhere the heck am I...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_6@Whatever, it's more important to eat my fill first!\nI can't wait to see what else could be in here~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_8@Ugh... but I still can't remember why I am here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_2_9@Eh? There's a open door to a room...\nI really want to go check it out... Meow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_1@Meowww~ Today's sun feels so good~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_10@Yeah... now that you mention it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_11@Ever since she arrived, she never participated in team practice or helped clean the dormitory...\nEveryday she just lazes about...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_12@Meowrr~ Is that stinky woman badmouthing Luna?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_13@She seems to be suffering from amnesia, so go easy on her...\nAt least she seems to be getting along with the others.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_14@I guess you're right... but... we can't keep her around like this forever...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_15@Also... who goes rummaging in trash cans and eats the trash...?\nShe even gifts dead rats and dead cockroaches... I... can't stand her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_16@What do you wish I do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_17@I wish... for her to leave...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_18@Let me think about it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_2@I should find a comfortable spot to continue my cat nap...\nAhh~ I might as well sleep on my personal mattress~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_20@Is Luna... going to be kicked out again...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_21@In the past... nobody wanted Luna... Luna could only hide in a ditch, shivering...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_25@That person... what was he thinking, giving me such a special power...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_26@Just what is Luna...?\nLuna isn't entirely a cat... but also isn't completely human...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_27@Bang~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_29@Luna... are you ok?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_3@Mattress~ where are you? I want to sleep on top of you, meowrr!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_30@I-I'm fine...\nAhh... it seems I scraped my hand... It's ok, I'll just lick it clean...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_31@Hahaha~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_32@W-What are you laughing at!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_33@Nothing, it's just that you really act like a cat...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_34@Um...! What's wrong with acting like a cat?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_35@Nothing, nothing... Don't get me wrong...\nYou just remind me of a cat that I used to feed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_36@A... cat?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_37@That's right. I used to feed a stray cat near the park. It loved to eat the taiyaki I brought it...\nEverytime it saw me, it would come out of hiding to greet me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_39@It was so cute~ Sadly, I threw out my back in training a while back and was basically rendered immobile...\nAfterwards, when I regained my mobility, I went back to the park, but the cat was nowhere to be found...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_40@By the way... What a coincidence... that you share the same name as that cat I used to feed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_41@Well... you can also... take care of me like you did for that cat...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_42@I was just going to say that...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_43@...R-Really?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_44@Some members of the team might be against it, but I don't think it will be a problem...\nThey only have issues with you not liking to take showers and your tendency to go rooting around in trash cans...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_45@If you can change these habits, you can continue staying here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_46@L-Luna... will do her best...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_47@Let's start from taking a bath then!\nRight this instant...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_48@N-No~~ A bath... Such a hard challenge right off the bat~~!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_5@Ugh... T-There's someone here!\nW-Why did I hide unconsciously...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_6@Um... player...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_7@Kana, what's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_8@Hmm...? It's that girl with the disgusting smell...\nWhat does she want with my mattress?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_3_9@Don't you think... that Luna... is kind of fishy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_1@Don't you want to see him again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_11@... T-This feeling... L-Luna...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_12@Luna is becoming weird... Meow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_15@Hmm? What are you all gathered here for?\nWhat are you guys secretly discussing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_16@Coach, have you heard... weird noises recently at night?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_17@Weird noises?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_18@It sounds like a cat... but isn't quite the same as a cat's meowing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_19@That's right! It sounds like a cat, but is surprisingly loud!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_2@M-Meoww...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_20@It's so loud that it has been keeping us up at night... player... can you check out what's going on?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_21@Alright... I'll keep an eye out...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_23@By the way... for the last couple of days... I keep smelling a strong scent on my clothes...\nThe same smell is also outside the door of my room... Did I get something weird on my clothes?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_24@Meow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_25@Luna...? Are you ok...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_26@Morning... player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_27@Morning? It's already noon...\nWere you unable to get a good night's sleep too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_28@I-I guess...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_29@The smell on Luna doesn't seem to be as strong anymore...\nIt seems that you took a nice long bath. You even smell good now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_3@Is that not your wish?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_32@There's a scratching sound... outside the door?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_34@I should check out what it is... I hope it isn't a thief...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_35@... Meow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_36@L-Luna?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_37@M-Meowrrr~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_38@It was you...? Were you using your body to rub up against the door?\nWere you also making a rucuss in the middle of the night and disturbing everyone's sleep?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_39@Luna's body... feels weird... I can't help it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_4@Ugh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_40@I can't help it... When I smell this scent, my body brings me here on its own accord...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_41@Y-Your body... is so hot... D-Do you have a fever...? Maybe you're sick?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_42@Meowrr... I-I don't know... but...\nLuna really wants to lie on top of player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_43@L-Luna...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_44@Mhmm~ Can I? Player...\nPlease... just let me lie on top of you for a while... is that alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_5@You not only crave to see him, I also know about the hidden desire within you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_6@Come now~ Stop holding back. Let me help you unleash your lust...\nI will make your wish... become reality...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_7@M-Meowwahhh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_8@Ugh! W-Where am I?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_4_9@Whew... I... I'm still here with player...\nWho was that person...? He said some really weird things to me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_1@It has been several weeks since I kept Luna here.\nOne day, everyone is sitting in the living room chatting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_10@Meow~ Luna has been wanting to lie here bathing in the sunlight! It's so warm and comfortable~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_11@Luna pulls up her top to expose her belly and rolls around on the balcony while wiping her face with the back of her palms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_12@If I'm seen doing this, they must ask me to take a shower. I'm so lucky that no one sees me here~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_13@Everyone in the living room that has witnessed everything remains silent for a few seconds.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_14@Actually, we all see you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_15@... I'll ask her to take a shower afterwards.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_16@Haha, I can already imagine how she will be struggling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_17@I won't step back only on this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_18@Kana clenches her tiny fists while deciding the hell-like torture Luna will be undergoing after some hours.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_2@By the way, Luna has been behaving better and better recently. She hasn't dug into the trash can for a long time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_3@Yes! And she also take initiative to sit at the table when it's time for meals. If she can't be there on time, she will come to my room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_4@Haha, Kana has also grown to accept her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_5@Because she is now willing to take a shower... though she still looks pretty reluctant...\nShe really looks like a cat in that way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_6@Eh? Speaking of the devil... Is that... Luna in the yard?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_7@Everyone turns around to the way Nadeshiko points at.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_8@It's breezing softly in the yard. Beneath the warm sunlight, Luna reaches her head out from the bush.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_1_9@After confirming that no one is around, Luna jumps up onto the balcony.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_1@Ten seconds before the training ends! Nine, eight, seven...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_10@Even though I don't know why she likes cat teaser wands so much, I still can't help making fun of her because she is just so cute when getting angry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_11@Alright, alright. Then I'll use what Luna likes to be a cat teaser wand for you. Is that okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_12@Without noticing the strange logic at all, Luna nods happily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_13@Luna likes taiyaki that has just been baked! It's not cold. Like~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_14@What? Last time you just said warm water was too hot... But freshly baked taiyaki is okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_15@It's good!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_16@She nods heavily with sparkling eyes. The only thing she's missing is yelling "Buy me one! Buy me one!"
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_17@... I got it. Since the performance of your training was great today, I'll reward you with taiyaki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_18@Yeaaaaahh~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_19@Looking at how Luna hops around me, I suddenly come up with a strange idea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_2@I keep counting down while being amused by Luna's dexterity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_20@(She's really like a cat... Could it be that she is actually...?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_21@(Haha, no way. Besides, if she really is a cat, then the taiyaki will really be a cat teaser wand. A hot cat teaser wand...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_22@(... Oh no. That sounds so inappropriate.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_3@(She's moving around the barrage of water shots without getting any hit. What's more, she looks like she's not paying any effort... Maybe her dexterity can be a new weapon of our team?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_4@However, in the last second, a butterfly flies into the court.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_5@Meeoww!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_6@The distracted Luna was shot by a strong ray of water, making herself soaking wet from the top to the bottom.\nAfter shaking the water on her body off, she growls at the water-shooting machine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_7@Cold! Hate, hate!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_8@You look just like... the cat that got mad when playing a cat teaser wand with me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P022_N_2_9@I'm not like that cat! I like cat teaser wand but I don't like water! Water is not a cat teaser wand!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_1@—Water Gun League Banquet—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_10@It must be tough... being the daughter of the League Chairman, and also having to be the host of this event. \Don't mind me if you're busy. Go do your thing~ 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_11@Make a scene... Who would do that in such a formal occasion? \nThe only explanation would be if they couldn't handle their alcohol...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_12@Hah~ A male~ \nHey! You there! I don't know where everyone went. Come and drink with me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_13@A person that can't handle their booze... \nNo way... what are the chances...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_14@Sorry, Ma'am... I'm currently indisposed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_15@Arghh~! Stop being such a pansy! \nYou are either down to drink or you aren't, which one is it?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_16@Hey~ On closer inspection... you don't look half bad! \nI'm Kagura~ Nice to meet you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_17@Here! Have a drink!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_18@I... really don't want to drink anymore right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_19@You talk too much! If you don't drink with me, that means you are looking down on me! \nDo you know who I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_2@Whew... I finally found an opportunity to excuse myself...\nI still can't get used to socializing no matter how hard I try... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_20@Ahhh~ I found her! She's over here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_21@A group of people surrounded the drunk girl and fenced her in. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_22@Hey! Get your hands off me! If I'm not able to hold a paintbrush, it'll be your fault! \nWill you be able to pay the price?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_23@Everyone, be careful. Miss Kagura is a national treasure. Be sure to treat her with the utmost respect and lead her to the VIP lounge for some rest... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_24@Nadeshiko... Who was that girl that called herself Kagura?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_25@Ah, I forgot to introduce you. Kagura is the daughter of the national artist, Genan, and is also a famous artist herself, renowned within the art community.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_26@Is she really an artist...? She seems more like a drunkard to me... \nCould her fame come from her father's influence?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_27@People first noticed and began discussing Kagura's works in small exhibitions. She even used an alias so that people could see her artwork for its beauty and not her background.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_28@She went to such extremes to showcase her talent... \nMaybe she's just like me... trying to escape from her father's shadow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_29@It's still hard to believe that she's anything but a beligerent drunkard...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_3@Coach~ I finally found you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_30@-The next day-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_31@Whew~ It took a whole morning, but I finally finished calculating the budget!\nI only have the afternoon training to worry about now~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_32@Coach~ Sorry to interrupt~ 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_33@Oh~ Nadeshiko? Come on in. \nLet me guess—there's been some change to the itenerary? That's the only explanation for your sudden visit. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_34@Hehe~ Coach, your intuition is still as sharp as ever. \nIndeed, something did come up...  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_35@Remember that artist we met last night at the banquet...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_36@You mean, Kagura, the drunkard? \nDon't tell me she wants a tour...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_37@You're 70% correct... \nWhat she wants is to... temporarily join the team and train together...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_38@T-train... that alcoholic? \nIsn't she an artist? Can she even pick up anything heavier than a paintbrush?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_39@I'm... not sure, but she has been waiting downstairs ever since the sun came up. \nWhy don't you let her tag along for the afternoon training and see how things go? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_4@Oh~ Good thing it's you, Nadeshiko...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_40@C-can I refuse...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_41@I'm afraid not... My father is her top sponsor... So, you know how it is... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_42@Sigh... All these politics... Fine, maybe I can find some reasons to turn her away without hurting her feelings. \nAfterall, not everyone is cut out to compete in water gun competitions!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_5@What's up? What's with the long face...?\nIs the banquet not to your liking?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_6@I-It's nothing... I just drank too much, so I'm feeling a bit tipsy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_7@Oh dear~ How about we go have you lie down somewhere with a fewer people?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_8@It's ok, I got this. Thanks for your concern.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_1_9@Well... I better take my leave. A special guest went missing today... \nEveryone's worried that she'll make a scene, so I was tasked with bringing her back... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_1@Um... Miss Kagura? \nYesterday...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_10@I understand. I've made up my mind the moment I heard about your team. \nFrom this day on, the artist Kagura is retiring from the art world! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_11@Uh... No... That's not what I meant...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_12@Please understand, this is my determination...! \nI have nothing to fall back to now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_13@F-fine... Come on. We can still make it to the afternoon training...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_14@Coach... You got trounced this round.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_15@This girl... her spirit and determination are astounding... \nWhat has she gone through to be able to make such an extreme decision?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_16@-Night-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_17@Good work during training everybody! Now get some rest. You all earned it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_18@Finally~ Some rest~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_19@Hurry~ Meet me in my room later for video games!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_2@I'm really sorry for what happened yesterday. It was completely my fault. \nI came here specifically to apologize to you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_20@Hehe~ It seems that everyone is still full of energy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_22@Kagura...? I should check up on her too, seeing how it's her first time participating in training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_23@Glug... Glug...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_24@I thought that I would hate breaking a sweat... \nbut I don't know when I started disliking the paintbrush even more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_25@Glug... Glug... Haaah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_26@Kagura... Sorry to interupt...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_27@Haha~ If it isn't Coach~ \nCome in~ Have a drink with me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_28@Ahh... The alcoholic Kagura is back...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_29@Hahaha~ What are you saying! \nThis is for all the hardwork during training today. Come on! Just one cup! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_3@What a change of attitude...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_30@I still have to lead training tomorrow... I'll pass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_32@Is she having a drunken fit again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_33@Coach... Can I ask you... \nWhat do you do best? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_34@Umm... Coming up with strategies... drawing training plans, and counseling team members... I guess?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_35@Have you ever thought what you would do... if one day, no new strategy comes to mind, or you just can't find the strength to come up with a training plan?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_36@Hmm... I probably wouldn't do anything at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_37@Does sitting on your hands solve anything? Hahaha~ \nIsn't that the same as me searching for happiness at the bottom of a beer...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_38@Time is better spent attempting things you would never usually do... \nrather than to spend your days moping about trying to rekindle your passion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_39@People are experience-based creatures that live in the moment. It doesn't matter who you are, if you repeat a task hundreds upon thousands of times, you are bound to become burned-out. You'll need novel experiences to keep things fresh. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_4@D-don't let it trouble you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_40@... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_41@At least that's what I believe... \nWhy do you ask?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_42@Maybe... I'm just waiting for someone to tell me what you just said...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_43@What's wrong? Why are you suddenly silent?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_44@Coach... Can I do something that I have never done before?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_45@Yes...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_46@Your shoulder... Could you let me put my head on your shoulder?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_47@Sure... but why...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_49@Uh... No way... she's already fast asleep?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_5@I'm so sorry that you had to see that side of me. I will pay special attention in the future...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_50@Sigh... What am I to do with you...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_6@I also have a... bold request... that I hope you'll agree to. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_7@Nadeshiko has told me about it. You want to be a temporary member of the water gun team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_8@If it isn't too much of a hassle, I hope that you can grant my request...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_2_9@We're a professional sports team, so if you don't have the determination... I'm afraid that your stay might be short-lived. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_1@I heard there will be a firework show today!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_10@You even chilled the glass... \nThis is such a refreshing feeling in this stuffy summer night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_11@I didn't think that player would agree to drink with me. Don't you have training tomorrow?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_12@How could I bring myself to say no and hurt the feelings of my team member. \nEspecially when she's giving it her all and training so hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_13@Alright, tonight's a special occasion. Let's drink together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_16@What? Why are you staring at me...? \nDo I have something on my face?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_17@No... I'm just thinking...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_18@`Bout what?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_19@Why does the night suit you so much better?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_2@Really? But I spent the whole day running along the beach. I really don't want to set foot outside anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_20@Oh? What makes you say that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_21@Kagura, during the day, you give it your all in training. You complete each excercise perfectly, \nbut I have never seen you smile. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_22@I have only seen a smile grace your face when we are out having a few drinks at night... \nHow should I put it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_23@A sense of belonging...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_24@I think that's it... It feels like you belong to the night. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_25@Hehe~ All these years... player is the one that really gets me... \nI made the right decision when I chose to join the team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_26@player... do you know? Even now, I still don't know if I really enjoy drawing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_27@When I used to draw with my father, I never stopped to think what I was personally good at drawing. \nI just emulated my father and later on, I copied the me that still believed I enjoyed drawing... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_28@Everyone says that I'm skilled at drawing, but no one sees the hesitation and confusion behind every stroke. It's progressed to the point that I feel anger and fear just from picking up a paintbrush...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_29@In the end... the only thing that I'm certain I enjoy... is drinking. \nAfter a cup or two, the world starts losing focus and everything becomes much simpler...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_3@We can still see it from indoors. Have you forgotten our dormitory has a killer view?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_30@To see everything for what it is leaves no space for imagination. That in turn becomes a burden. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_31@Hahaha~ player you really get me and how to maintain the perfect distance. \nWhy couldn't we have met each other earlier...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_32@Fwooosh~~~ Boom!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_33@The show is starting...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_34@Ahh~ Such dazzling and colorful lights... What more can I ask for in life? \nCheers! To delicous alcohol and a person that understands me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_35@Alright~ Let's drink the night away. Bring it~ \nGlug... Glug...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_37@Light is such an eye-dazzling thing... Hey~ player, have you ever imagined yourself turning into light?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_38@I must say I have never imagined that. But if I could... I want to become darkness...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_39@Darkness? Why is that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_4@Coach, are we going to go see the fireworks like we used to before?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_40@Light is indistinguisable during the daytime, only during the night is its importance magnified... \nI want to become darkness, and be the platform for myriad colors to shine. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_41@Light... and darkness? Hehe~ That's so you, Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_42@Then~ Mr. Dark Night, can you invite Miss Moonlight on a midnight tryst?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_43@It is my pleasure to be able to serve as the backdrop for the pure moonlight. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_5@Sorry, Saki... I have plans today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_6@Oh~ What a pity... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_7@I feel bad for turning down Saki's invitation... but I really do have something tonight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_8@player, you're here! \nThis glass is for you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_3_9@C'mon~ Cheers!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_1@Does everyone know why today is an important day?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_10@I prepared some liquid courage for you, drink up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_11@This taste... isn't this the alcohol we drank that night? \nAre you sure I should be drinking before a competition?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_12@Don't worry~ The alcohol will evaporate through your sweat. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_13@So this will be our little secret, ok?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_14@Really now... you'll need to take full responsibility if we're caught!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_16@Haha... My whole body feels lighter already, and I'm not nervous at all... Hahaha~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_17@Then... off I go! \nThank you... player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_18@Becoming the darkness that contrasts the light is my responsibilty. \nAs for how brightly you'll be able to shine, that's up to you. Good luck!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_19@In the past... I was very stubborn and focused on the responsiblities of a national artist. \nI kept pushing myself to pick up the paintbrush and do what I don't enjoy. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_2@Yes! It's Kagura's debut battle!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_20@Failure was not allowed, nor was giving up... \nYet now, it feels like I can finally let go of that burden on my shoulder...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_22@Such is the wonders of life. Once you know that you can take a break now and then... \nCreativity is springing forth once more inside my head... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_23@It seems like... I will be able to pick up the paintbrush once again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_24@It's just like I said. \nSpend your days moping about trying to rekindle your passion gets you nowhere...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_25@Time is better spent attempting things you would never usually do... \nplayer... I think I understand this principle now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_26@If there is time after the match... player... I want to show my gratitude...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_27@Please be my personal darkness so I can experience greater pleasures in life. Let me blossom...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_28@And taste the pleasures of a female... Just you... and I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_3@Yay! After all her hardwork, Kagura's finally competing in her first battle!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_4@Congrats, Kagura!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_5@Thanks everyone. I'll do my best not to get in everyone's way. I'll be in your care~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_6@In order to leave a good first impression to the crowd, everyone keep an eye on Kagura and help her out if needed. \nIf we're all clear... warm up! Let's go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_7@I'm finally going to step onto the field... I'm as nervous as the first time I exhibited my artwork... \nIt seems like no matter the environment, the first time is always the same...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_8@Kagura...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_4_9@C-coach?! \nYou scared me... What's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_10@... Well, Kagura.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_12@May I know the reason why I'm tied on a chair?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_13@So that you can perform the tension of struggle.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_14@And how about blindfolding me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_15@The fear of not seeing anything leads to a powerless feeling.\nAlright. Stop talking and let me focus on drawing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_16@It is completely different from what I have thought. Kagura invited me here because she wanted me to be her model.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_17@Men possess more powerful physical ability and strength. However, those advantages may also be cages and restrained... That's the paradox I want to draw in order to strengthen the despairing atmosphere in my painting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_18@I guess this painting somehow shows my mind.\nI want to draw, but I can't draw anything. It's like my hands have never belonged to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_19@But no guy was willing to give up his power of control, especially in front of a female painter. So I couldn't finish this painting... until I met you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_20@If I can finish this painting successfully, maybe I'll finally be able to step out of the shadow of my father and blossom as a female painter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_21@Thinking about how Kagura would look when she said so, I feel pitiful for her, so I can't help moving my hands.\nBut the bondage on me reminds me of my current circumstance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_22@(Sigh. Fine. This should be the meaning of my life.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_23@(But now that I can't see anything, I've really become "the darkness that contrasts the light"...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_4@Because of Kagura's words, I restlessly come to the front of her room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_5@The pleasures of a female... Is that what I'm thinking about?\n... Damn... I just can't control my heartbeat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_6@player? Are you out there?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_7@Y-Yes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_1_8@The door slowly opens.\nBut before I can see the inner decoration, I'm dragged into the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_1@While browsing the news page, I read out the headline today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_10@You've come at the perfect timing. I just finished preparing the "sake bath."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_11@Sake bath... Do you mean it's all sake inside?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_12@Of course I've added some water into it. Otherwise, it would be too stimulative.\nHmm~ I feel my body become lighter just by smelling it. I'll be the first to enjoy it then!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_13@Wait! Hold on! Don't start undressing yourself before you finish the sentence!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_14@I turn my head away and heard the sound of her jumping into the pool.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_15@Ahh~ It's true that other than drawing, alcohol is the only thing that makes me happy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_16@Kagura's lazy voice sounds so tempting.\nTo distract myself from it, I try to find some topics to talk about.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_17@D-Do you like drinking so much because you don't have to think about anything while drinking?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_18@Yes. And meanwhile, I can think about everything~ Because it's so relaxing and free just like in heaven!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_19@Drinking is heaven, and bathing in alcohol is the heaven above heaven!\nYou'll never know what I'm talking about just by standing there. How about come in and enjoy it with me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_2@Congrats! Kagura, the national artist sold her latest painting at a sky-high price...\nWow! This number can pay the expense of the team for a year. Congrats, Kagura.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_20@I swallow and carefully look over where she is.\nKagura is lying by the side of the pool, with her curvy body slightly showing under the liquor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_21@(For me, it's already another kind of heaven...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_3@Haha, it's all thanks to you that I can keep painting.\nI've already ordered some nice liquor with that money. Let's enjoy it together when it arrives.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_4@Sure. I'm looking forward to that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_5@I guess the drinking date would be just like how we drank last time beneath the fireworks. However...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_6@Kagura said that the liquor is ready, but she asked me to come to the pool...\nWhat on earth is she up to?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_7@I keep nagging when I open the door to the pool and smell a thick fragrance of alcohol.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_8@This... It's...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P023_N_2_9@The huge pool that can contain all members of the team is now filled with milky liquid, with Kagura standing by it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_1@-Deep in the mountains around the suburbs of Star City-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_10@Your country may believe that this is an exorcism, but here... foxes turning into humans to play pranks is part of our tradition! Different cultures, ya know?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_11@Different cultures have nothing to do with this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_12@Coach... Could it be... that you are in debt... \nYou need to make fast money, so now you're taking on all kinds of odd jobs...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_14@T-T-That's definitely not what's going on... W-W-Where did you come up with such a preposterous idea... Hehe... Heh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_15@Something's definitely fishy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_16@Ok, this is where the monk told us that the fox spirit often appears. Let's split up and look around first. Remember, if you see anything abnormal, just observe and report back to me... got it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_18@Alright, if we can successfully catch this fox, I'll be able to make up for the shortage in funds when our sponsors ditched us during our losing streak...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_19@Hehe~ Good evening~ \nThe moon is just as beautiful as always today~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_2@I'll leave the rest up to you guys... This fox spirit often plays pranks on the followers and tourists that come here to worship. We won't be able to keep our doors open much longer if she isn't dealt with...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_20@Such a beautiful girl...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_21@Have you come to worship at this shrine too? Rumor has it that the deity here is renowned for its matchmaking powers... \nAre you also looking for a good relationship?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_22@Y-Yes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_23@This girl... has such a nice smell...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_24@Hehe~ It looks like the rumors are true~ My wish is about to come true...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_25@Mine... too...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_26@Hehe~ Sweet dreams now~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_27@Coach... Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_28@Ugh... Where am I...? W-What happened?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_29@You were buck naked with stuff written on you. I wiped it off for you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_3@Leave it to us! \nThere is no better choice to take on this hunt than the Squirt Gun team! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_30@What was wri-written on me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_31@A good squirt gun coach is honest, isn't shady, and doesn't go around smelling girls...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_32@... That stinking fox... You've pissed me off... I'm definitely going to catch you now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_33@Coach... do you have a plan?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_34@Hmphh... Strategic planning is what I'm best at... Here's what we'll do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_36@Heh... Poor chump, the sun's about to come up and he's still fast asleep. Is my sleep scent really that effective? \nOr could it be that he's too weak?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_37@Hmm~ Living is only prolonging his pain for a feeble person like him. I might as well end his suffering and suck dry his essence!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_38@First, let me place my hand on his chest... \nHmm... My hand... it's stuck?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_39@W-What is this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_4@Coach... is it really OK to bite off more than we can chew?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_40@I've got you now, you fox! Rise, my adorable team member invented this super sticky mucus! \nYou won't be able to take your hand off my body now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_41@You... actually pretended to be unconscious while being completely naked all this time...? \nI can't believe someone could actually be so brazenly shameless...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_42@Listen to the pot calling the kettle black! You're the one that made all of my clothes disappear... \nYou're the perverted one...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_43@S-Shut up! This is all to prank humans!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_44@But right now you're the one that can't keep your hands off me! \nNow's our chance! Come out, Riria!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_45@Boom!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_46@Is this girl a monster...?! S-She can even crack stone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_47@How dare you... toy with Coach... You will pay the price!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_48@... I-I'm sorry... I apologize... Please, just let me go...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_49@I'm just a little fox that lives nearby. I just play pranks on followers and tourists for fun... \nI don't mean no harm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_5@We can handle this just fine! Riria has experience hunting and all of the members of the team have undergone professional shooting training. We got this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_50@So when you said that you wanted to suck dry my essence and end my suffering... \nDid you mean no harm too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_51@... I... about that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_52@Sob~ I'm sorry... I was just bluffing... Please, don't hurt me... \nI'll leave and won't show my face in front of any humans anymore... I give my word...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_53@Coach... What do we do...? She looks so pitiful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_54@Well... I think so too...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_55@Now's my chance! Fox Fire!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_56@Woahhh! That was close!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_57@The mucus evaporated from the heat!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_58@Hmphh~ I have your scent now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_59@I let down my guard this time! But the next time I'll make sure to get you back! \nI'm the great Fox Spirit! Kikyou! Remember my name!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_6@But... my aim... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_60@Coach... What do we do...? She says that she'll come back for revenge... \nI knew we shouldn't have taken on weird jobs!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_61@This sly fox...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_7@There's no helping it... You're the only person with hunting experience in the team, Riria...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_8@That's why I told you... Don't go around promising people things that we can't deliver!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_1_9@Plus, this isn't any normal hunt. It's an exorcism! Coach, an exorcism!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_1@Damn human! How dare he trick me... \nIf the elders in my village learn of this, they'll tan my hide...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_10@Beep~! Don't straggle too far behind!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_11@That voice... It's the guy! \nFinally... I can have my revenge!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_12@Pant... Pant... Coach... I-I... can't... Wait up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_13@Hmph... Girl, I have decided to use your face to take my revenge!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_15@Alright~ Preparations are complete! \nI've put the girl in a temporary slumber, tied her hands and feet, and taped her mouth shut.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_16@Next, I'll seduce the Coach. When he gets all handsy with me, I'll loudly scream out for help. \nEveryone will see just how perverted he truly is! His reputation will be ruined!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_17@Perfect! That's exactly what I'll do!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_18@Hey~ What are you saying is perfect?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_19@Eek...! H-Have I been found out...? \nWhen did he get so close to me... I didn't even notice...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_2@I have the scent of that man. I must get rid of this nuisance before word reaches the village!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_20@What are you mumbling about... Kagura...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_21@Ah... it's nothing... I'm just...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_22@I saw you really struggling while running out there. Here, have a drink!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_23@T-This is...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_24@This is the Momohime I promised you last time! I had to search a couple of stores to find this plum wine. \nIt is an excellent bottle with hints of peach~  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_25@B-But I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_26@But what? This wasn't like you when you were trying to get me drunk that night we were watching fireworks... \nAre you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_27@N-No... I-I-I'm fine... I-I can't...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_28@You're acting very suspicious~ You don't usually say no to alcohol...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_29@Fine... I-I'll drink... \n(Glug glug)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_3@He'd better watch his back! I'll have his head by tomorrow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_30@T-There... I finished it... \nI'm fine... so...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_31@T-The whole bottle...? Are you really ok...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_32@Of course~! What problem could there be~ I'm the great fox spirit Kikyou~ \nThere's nothing I can't handle~ Hahah! Let's drink some more!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_33@Kikyou...? The Kikyou that I released in the mountain shrine and was going on about getting revenge...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_34@C-Crap... Why did I... \nIt must be because of the alcohol...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_35@I thought you were all talk last time, but you still had me worried for a couple of days... \nI didn't expect you to really come seek vengence...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_36@But right now... I don't think you can get away even if you wanted to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_37@H-Human... don't get too cocky...! \nHave a taste of my... Fox Fire...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_38@N-No you don't!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_39@M-My tail... Ahhh
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_4@-5 days later-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_40@Hmm? Why did she suddenly collapse...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_41@D-Don't grab my tail, please...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_42@Why are you like this... Where did that arrogant fox go...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_43@M-My tail is off limits... Ahh... Don't grab it like that... I'll... I'll...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_44@You'll...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_45@Once a fox's tail is grabbed... they become completely defenseless... \nI beg you... Let me go... I'll return to my village...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_46@Look what happened the last time I let you go. I won't be falling for your tricks once again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_47@No... It is different this time... I'm begging you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_48@This time... I'll return to your side... but I won't be looking for revenge anymore... \nI can't... do this anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_5@I... finally made it out of this mountain...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_50@Your expression... is different from before... I guess I'll believe you one more time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_6@Greetings... sister. Have you come here for worship? \nEver since the fox spirit was chased away, you must all feel safer already!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_7@... Sob... It looks like I got lost again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_8@-10 days later-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_2_9@F-Finally... God... I am so done with this tendency to lose my way...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_1@-Spirit Fox Village, deep in the mountains-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_10@Kikyou knows that she has done wrong... Elders, please forgive Kikyou...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_11@If a Fox Spirit is unable to reenact revenge, they must continue training until they are able to defeat the person that got the best of them. \nBut, if your tail falls into the hands of someone else, then there is only one path left...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_12@You must remove your tail. This signifies that you will be giving up the majority of your powers and starting afresh your training. \nYou will also have to serve under the person who grabbed your tail as your new master and remember the shame at all times!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_14@Next... when the time is ripe... Kill him! \nOnly then will you be able to reclaim your title of a Fox Spirit!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_16@So... That's the reason that you wanted me to take you in no matter what...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_17@That's right... From this day on, player, you are my new master... \nI am in your care.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_18@You want me to take you in, so you can find a chance to kill me...? \nDo you think I'm the kind of stupid person that would do something like that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_19@Senpai... How could you have another woman...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_2@Kikyou... You've finally returned...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_20@The male essence that I crave! I want to suck the marrow from your bones!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_21@Hmm... I guess I really am that kind of person... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_22@Please... player... \nIf even you don't take me in, I won't have anywhere left to turn to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_23@You can stay... but on one condition.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_24@As long as I can stay by your side, I can promise you anything... \nBut if you want me to change my goal... I'm afraid I won't be able to do so...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_25@I won't force that on you, but... you'll have to join my squirt gun team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_26@J-Join your squirt gun team? \n You want me to participate in competitions?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_27@That's right, and as long as you can lead the team to 20,000 victories... \nI'll let you be able to complete your Elder's biddings!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_28@R-Really?! That's awesome~ If it's 20,000 victories... \nThat'll only take me about ten or so years. It should be a piece of cake. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_29@Silly kid... There are only 200 matches in an annual squirt gun season. It would take you at least 100 years... \nThere's no way you're going to be able to do that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_3@Yes... Elder...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_30@Not only did I gain a free squirt gun team member that has spirit power, but I have also gained a servant... \nI knew I was a genius. When I set my mind to evil, even I am scared of myself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_31@Well... it's settled then!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_32@Ok! From this day on, you will be my new master! \nHehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_33@Alright... are you ready to participate in the training later? \nToday we will be doing jogs along the beach and shooting practice!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_34@Wait...! W-We're beginning now?! \nA Fox Spirit without her powers is a useless Fox Spirit. Ahhh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_4@Word of the mischief you caused last month has reached the village... \nWhy didn't you come back sooner to report? Why did we have to send someone out to get you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_5@That's because... I-I... still have one more chance to get revenge. If I succeed... \nI won't have to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_6@Yet, I heard that not only did you fail, your tail was also grabbed by a human... Am I right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_7@You... have brought shame to all Fox Spirits... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_8@The source of our magic and power... \nOnce it is grabbed by a human, do you know what that means?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_3_9@I still have much to learn... I have also sullied the name of the Fox Spirits so arduously established by Master Tamamo...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_1@Hup~ Hup~ \nI will do my best to clean Master's living quarters today!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_10@You don't have a tail anymore. Do you have phantom limb syndrome?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_11@N-No... It's because if you touch me there... I'll... I'll...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_12@Hmm...? Why does she suddenly turn so timid after I touch her ass...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_13@I won't have anymore impure thoughts... Please... Master, stop touching me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_14@Alright... I'm sorry. I just wanted to tease you... \nIf there's nothing else, we'll be making our way to the hotspring hotel this afternoon to celebrate. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_15@C-Celebrate...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_17@Wow~ It's a hotspring! Amazing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_18@Hehe~ The beds are all made... If that's the case... I'll just take a little practice nap...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_19@Tomoka~ Don't go rushing to fall asleep yet!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_2@I don't mean to complain... but... I can't believe a Fox Spirit like me has to do such menial tasks... Sigh~ 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_20@Haha~ What a lively bunch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_21@Ok, you're all free to do whatever you want now. \nEveryone enjoy this celebration dedicated to Kikyou!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_22@Thank you, Kikyou~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_23@F-For... me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_24@Ever since you joined the team, you broke our losing streak and turned things around. \nWe have even made it out of B League to A League. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_25@Keep up the good work, and don't get hurt! \nRelax and enjoy the hotsprings. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_26@Thank you, Master...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_27@Ahh~ I should go soak in the hotsprings. I'll join you all later for dinner. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_29@Ahh~ This is the best... Such a large hotspring, and I'm the only one here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_3@Also what's up with the 20,000 victories?! \nNadeshiko told me today that there's only 200 matches in a squirt gun season!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_30@... Excuse me... Sorry to bother you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_31@K-Kikyou?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_32@May I have permssion... to join Master in the hotspring?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_33@O-Of course... Help yourself...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_34@Then... I'm coming in...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_35@Under the moonlight and the reflection of the lights in the pool... \nKikyou's pure skin glitters beautifully...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_36@Master... player... What are you thinking about, looking at me like that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_37@N-Nothing at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_38@I swallow... I would be lying if I said that after looking at Kikyou's skin and her alluring eyes \nI didn't have any reaction at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_39@Hey... player... Did you know...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_4@A human's average life expectancy is only 80 years. At that time, I thought that humans could live thousands of years just like us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_40@Because I was defeated by a human, the rules of the village dictate that... I must get my revenge...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_41@Yet, I even had my tail touched by you... This is the greatest shame to Fox Spirits... \nSo I was unable to keep my tail... and must start my training anew...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_42@S-So...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_43@The tail is where all of a Fox Spirit's power is concentrated... It is also the most sensitive spot on their body... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_44@When a fox has lost their powers, but their instinct to gather spiritual energy has been awakened... \nthey can only do one thing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_45@Is it because I touched your ass again this morning...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_46@Can you promise me one thing right now...? \nKikyou wants to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_5@Such a deceitful human... Why wait, I should just... today...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_6@Just... what today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_8@Why don't you tell me what you're planning to do~ \nOh, great Fox Spirit Kikyou~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_4_9@D-Don't touch my tail...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_1@I can feel my rationality fading away due to Kikyiou's arm around my waist and the heat of the hot spring.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_10@Great! Looks like both cleaning the environment and winning matches for the team are counted as "training." I've finally regained some power.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_11@But my spiritual power is still so weak that I can only teleport to a lake nearby.\nOriginally I wanted to send you to a beach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_12@... So that means... you've already used up all your spiritual power in that teleportation, haven't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_13@... Eh?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_14@Kikyou, who has been murmuring by the pool suddenly senses danger from my words and wants to flee.\nHowever, everything's already too late.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_15@I gather my power to jump out from the lake and hug Kikyou. After I slightly turn my body around, I press her against the ground beneath my body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_16@Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_17@Kikyou, whose body is now pinned down by me, is unable to move even an inch. The only thing she can do is lying on the shallow bank of the lake looking at me in panic.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_18@The tight clothes of Kikyou soon become soaking wet with the lake water, which makes her look even sexier.\nI smirk at her gorgeous body line revealing from the transparent fabric.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_19@Alright. You mischievous fox... Now how should I punish you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_2@So... So that's how it is... What do you want to do then...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_3@While asking the question, I slide my hand towards Kikyou's butt to see her reaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_4@Hehee~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_5@Kikyou smiles flirtatiously as she puts her arms around my neck and leans her body down on me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_6@(Her breasts! They're going to touch──)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_7@Just when I'm ready to embrace the heavenly happiness, Kikyou's body suddenly disappears into a silk of smoke.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_8@──So cold!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_1_9@I can't help jumping up because of chilliness. Now that I look around again, we're not at a steamy hot spring but at a desolate lake.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_1@It has been a day since we came back from the hot spring hotel.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_10@Oh, that? I love that, too!\nI'll make it tonight then! I shall go to buy the ingredients now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_11@Humph, easy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_13@Sorry for keeping you waiting. The dessert today is candied strawberries specially made by Kana!\nMiss Kikyou, please enjoy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_14@... No.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_15@Eh? It's not what Miss Kikyou wants to eat?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_16@Sorry for misunderstanding you...\nOr you actually meant sweet and sour fish? It's sweet and sour, and I'll also add some black pepper...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_17@(... I was just too naive. How can a human who likes to waste delicious fish like that even understand my hint? I'll have to use another method.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_19@The flyer about the sale in the supermarket is here. Let's see what's on sale...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_2@In the early morning, Kikyou lurches out to the living room with a hand supporting her waist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_20@Wow, tofu pockets and sushi rice are so cheap right now! And also sesame...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_21@Wonderful! Then I'll make inari sushi tonight!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_22@Kikyou sighs after she hears the keyword from afar.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_23@She finally got the answer.\nThen it was worth it for me to hypnotize the supermarket owner. Fortunately, the spiritual power I accumulated laboriously didn't go to waste.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_24@Inari sushi... Hehe, I can't wait~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_3@Darn. I can't believe he forced me to do sit-ups in the water when I had drained my power...\nI've remembered it, player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_4@Now I end up with no energy to even do any training... Looks like I really need to eat something.\n... I want to eat "that" so bad...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_5@Miss Kikyou, what did you say you want to eat?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_6@Woah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_7@(This girl that suddenly appeared behind me... I remember she is Kana, the girl who's good at cooking.\nMaybe she can...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_8@(... But I'll be losing my dignity as a fox spirit if I just ask a human for food. Let me think...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P024_N_2_9@You know... the food that tastes sweet from the outside, sour on the inside, and with some black dots on it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_1@21, 22... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_10@Coach, you're having Saki buy such things for you...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_11@Cough... This is just a normal grocery run.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_12@Saki is more than happy to help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_13@See, Saki doesn't mind. \nWhy don't you go get some rest, Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_14@OK! Oh yeah, one more thing... I just got this, Coach can have it. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_15@What's this... Follow the Goddess's way, and She will grant you extreme pleasure? \nUh, is this some religious flyer? I didn't know we had a church nearby.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_16@There's a new church on the plot of land next to us. The stained glass windows are really pretty. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_17@What? No way, the land right has been settled?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_18@I never received word... Could it be, that my intelligence collecting skills has gotten rusty?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_19@Upon this thought, I slam my hand against the table and stand up. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_2@I look through the basic information of the team members. \nOn one hand, I'm glad that there is a large roster; but on the other hand, it's starting to become quite troublesome. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_20@... As a coach, I will not let this happen under my nose. I'm going to go check it out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_22@The spires of the brand new church glint under the warm afternoon sunlight. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_23@Unbelievable, they really built a church...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_24@Shoot! If I had gotten wind earlier, maybe there would still be a chance. \nNow I need to look for a new training location...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_25@Speaking of which... With such a small training facility, it's inevitable to have some body contacts. If I accidently touch somewhere indecent... Hehe, what an inconvenience~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_26@As I was daydreaming, a flyer suddenly appeared before my eyes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_27@The Goddess above wishes you happiness. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_28@Uh, no thanks, I'm not...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_29@Woah! A smoking hottie!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_3@Having a full roster to choose from may be a good thing, but recently during training, there has been frequent friction between groups. This in turn has affected the quality of training...  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_30@The girl in front of me is dressed like a nun, but that doesn't take away from her beauty. \nI immediately forget to refuse the flyer and accept it in a daze. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_31@Hehe... I see that you're from next door. Are you a resident?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_32@Ah, yes. That's correct. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_33@That makes us neighbors. How should I address you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_34@player... Just call me player. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_35@The pretty girl smiles and I can smell a faint mysterious fragrance emanating from her body. \nMy mind is a complete blissful mess.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_36@player, I am the humble servant of the Goddess, Sora. \nDo you have time to learn more about my church and your neighbor?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_37@I am pulled back from my thoughts by the "humble servant of the Goddess." \nI take an awkward step back from her outstretched right hand. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_38@About that, I... um... have something today. It might not be the best time... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_39@Oh my, am I taking up your time? I'm so sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_4@In the end, the problem still boils down to not having enough space.\nNadeshiko, do you think we would be able to apply for a larger training facility?  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_40@Thank you for listening to me. You are really a nice person! \nMay the Goddess bless you. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_41@Sora places both hands in front of her and bows to me before leaving. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_42@I thought that she would be more persistant. Who knew that she would be so polite and classy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_43@I lower my head. \nOn the flyer I just accepted, the Goddess has her hands folded and emits a soft yet holy glow.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_44@Maybe next time... it wouldn't hurt to take a look?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_5@Well... The League doesn't have any spare facilities.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_6@That being said, isn't there an empty plot of land next to us? If no one is using it, maybe we can rent it out as a training ground. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_7@That won't work. I've already inquired about it. The land right is very complicated with no solution in sight. That's why the plot has been empty, or else it would have been a perfect place to train. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_1_9@Coach, I'm back. Here's your extreme lube you asked for. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_1@I take the hand of an old lady and help her cross the busy road. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_10@... What's going on?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_11@Someone stops me midway to the church. \nHe looks like a scoundrel up to no good with a baseball bat in one hand and a scowl on his face.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_12@It's none of your business, just get lost. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_13@Without waiting for me to answer, the hooligan turns around and leaves. I look to where he is walking and see a couple of cars blocking the road. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_14@Could it be a gang war...? \nWhat bad luck. I guess I can only go back to the dormitory for now. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_16@I'm back~ Hmm? What are you all doing by the windows? What's so interesting?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_17@Coach! Thank god you made it back in one piece. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_18@You all look like you've seen a ghost. What's going on?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_19@Akane was returning home from the market when she found out that a group of people was blocking the path. She had to take a large detour to get back. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_2@Here we are. Be careful now. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_20@They had weapons... It all seems really dangerous...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_21@I believe that they're looking for trouble. The church is already surrounded...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_22@The church?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_23@I freeze for a moment before also peeking out of the window. \nIt is possible to just barely see the church from this position. The outside of the church is already surrounded by a sea of people. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_24@I'm thinking that could the problem be because of the rights to that plot of land? That's why gangsters were brought into the mix...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_25@So you're saying that the church was built disregarding the land right dispute? No wonder I didn't receive word...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_26@... If that's the case, then Sora... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_27@As if sensing my worry, the crowd suddenly becomes agitated and faint sound of yelling can be heard. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_28@... I'll be right back. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_3@Thank you young one. You are a kind person. Good karma will surely come your way. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_31@It might be because the conflict has already escalated, this time I am not stopped by anyone. I bypass the gang members to arrive in front of the church.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_32@The church is built on a slightly elevated piece of land with stairs leading to the front door. A nun stands at the top of the stairs. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_33@Have you all gathered here today before the Goddess to bathe in her holy light?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_34@Hey bitch! Get off your high horse! \nWho gave you the balls to build here without the approval of our boss? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_35@Hmm... maybe it's "this"?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_36@Sora smiles as she makes a money sign with her fingers. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_37@I bought this piece of land with my money and I also applied for a building permit... The process may have been more frought with peril than expected, but this must be the Goddess testing my resolve.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_38@Stop with that Goddess bullshit! It seems that she won't understand if we don't teach her a lesson. Get her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_39@Ohhhh! Get her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_4@The old lady shuffles away with her cane, but my mind wanders off as I stick both hands into my pockets. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_40@Hey, hey! Calm down guys! Ooof!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_41@I try to stop the gang members, but then get pushed out of the way and bang my leg on a planter. \nI kneel down in pain. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_42@At the same time, all the gang members rush for the stairs with weapons in hand. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_43@Damn it. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_44@I hastily pick up my phone to call the police, but when I raise my head, I am surprised to see Sora let out a sigh.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_45@It still comes to this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_46@... No, I should say, thankfully it has come to this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_47@Sora suddenly whips out an SMG from behind her back and sprays the crowd of hooligans. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_48@Get lost! Get lost! Get lost! What boss? This gun is the boss right now! Hahahaha~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_49@Shit! This woman...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_5@A kind person? I remember someone also called me that recently...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_50@She's using rubber bullets!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_51@It's still lethal in close proximity! Retreat!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_52@The gang members help each other to hobble away and dive into their cars to make their escape. \nSoon, the only things left are bullet casings on the ground and me sitting numbly by the flower bed. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_53@Hmm? If it isn't player?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_54@Uh, I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_55@As I was about to back away subconsciously, Sora put down her SMG and let out a warm, cute smile. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_56@I'm so sorry. I was taking out the trash, so it might be a little messy... \nDo you want to come in for some tea? I can also share more of the Goddess's word. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_57@... Is she really the same girl that was mowing down the punks just then? Is she bipolar?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_58@No, that's not the point! Isn't it illegal to have a gun?! \nI can't believe that her reaction is to invite an eyewitness in for tea... Just how badly does she want to spread the gospel! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_6@Sora's smiling face appears in my mind and it's as if I can still smell her faint fragrance. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_7@... Maybe it's time to go check out the church. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_2_9@This area is off-limits. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_1@The water has boiled. Please sit tight. I'll be right back. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_10@Alright, no problem! I'll go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_11@Please stop clenching your fists! Your veins are popping out! Ahhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_13@I end my reminiscing as Sora puts a steaming hot cup of tea into my hands and sits down next to me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_14@Who would have thought that the angel smiling so serenely in front of me could turn into a devil on the battlefield in the blink of an eye. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_15@She's intimidating for sure, but didn't she successfully hold her own against those gangsters...? \nI take a sip of tea and decide to get to the bottom of things before Sora starts preaching to me.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_16@Sora, those people were here for you, right? Is it because of the conflict regarding land rights?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_17@So you heard? How embarassing. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_18@That is indeed the reason on a more surface level. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_19@On the surface?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_2@Thank you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_20@I can't deny the land rights to this plot is complicated, but I spent some time and finally settled everything. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_21@So you mean that the problem runs deeper...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_22@Right. When I was preaching in another area, this gang had already been a thorn in my side. \nBut I don't know the reason for it either... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_23@No one would go out of their way to get all up in someone's business without a reason, right? \nMaybe if you think harder you may find a clue. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_24@I can't help but analyze the situation as Sora thinks back with her head cocked to one side. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_25@Let me see... \nWait... There was this one time that they kept saying, "You can't spread the gospel like this!" Could that be the reason?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_26@Hmm... The way you preach is to invite people to come to your church to learn more about the religion, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_27@That's right. Under the Goddess's guidance, we can grant people extreme pleasure. Many people in need have found their way in life as a result. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_28@... Extreme pleasure sounds kind of suspicious, but I think I know the reason for why you are being targeted now. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_3@I sit at a pew not knowing where to put my hands as I watch Sora walk inside to the back of the church to pour me a cup of tea. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_30@You should know that people in the lower levels of society are very easily controlled by gangs. \nIn other words, those same people are just resources for gang development. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_31@Now that you're helping people in need get on their feet, isn't that chipping away at the foundations of gangs? \nOf course they would come looking for trouble. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_32@I see, so that's what's happening... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_33@Sora's face is one of sudden understanding, but soon she laughs coldly. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_34@May the Goddess above be my witness. I shall not let them obstruct the road to heaven. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_35@You are a hot-headed one...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_36@I don't think the gang will give up so easily either, just look at how they chased you from one area to another. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_38@If that's so, I should go stock up on ammunition...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_39@(Is that what she's worrying about?!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_4@The space inside of the church is kept immaculately clean. The sunlight that filters in through the windows is like a holy psalm from the heavens. Sora's slender figures only adds to the peacefulness of the atmosphere. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_40@(No matter how strong she is, there is still a limit to what one person can accomplish. \nI think I could be of help...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_41@(Wait... it may seem that Sora is the one being picked on right now, \nbut I don't know if this church is credible or not... I should investigate further.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_42@So, I keep hearing you talk about your Goddess. Just what kind of god is she?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_43@You're interested?! May the Goddess bless you! \nLet me start from the creation of our religion! Long, long time ago...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_45@It's really late and Coach still hasn't returned... Could something have happened to him?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_47@Someone's at the door. Who is it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_48@... C-Coach?! Why are you on the ground? \nDid something happen at the church?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_49@Ughh! I-I don't want to hear anything church-related for now... I feel like I've been force-fed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_5@I can't help but playback the events that just happened on repeat inside of my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_51@Even if Sora's face is really nice to look at... \nThere's no way I am able to handle a couple hours of non-stop preaching.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_52@That being said, I also got what I wanted—the church isn't involved in any illegal activities. \nSo, all that is left is to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_53@Riria, there's something I want to discuss with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_7@You sure you don't want to come in? I can put on some tea and share with you the word of the Goddess. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_8@I-I'm good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_3_9@Don't be so polite. I insist~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_1@Alright, I've done the team analysis, and it's time for some exercise...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_10@What if the believers get hurt... How can I deal with that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_11@... So that's what you care about the most now...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_12@Hm? Pardon?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_13@I just said that you don't have to worry about anything.\nYou just have to keep doing your missionary work right here while I tackle this issue for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_14@How can I trouble someone that has nothing to do with this...\nI'm not dragging you into this kind of abnormal incident just because of my personal issue.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_15@This really is none of my business, but I can't say this kind of incident is abnormal to us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_16@Anyway, I've got a plan. Just leave it to me and keep being an angel here as always.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_17@Angel? I'm not...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_18@Ah, right. I should say "the Goddess's messenger."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_19@However, I find the name angel suits you a lot, too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_2@Hm? Sora? Why are you standing here at the alley?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_21@Even when you're in danger, you're still worrying about others...\nIt's not an exaggeration at all to call you a real angel.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_22@Therefore, the angel's responsibility is to keep smiling and stop frowning. Don't you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_23@Beneath the starry sky, Sora blinks several times and finally regains her composure, with a slight smile blooming on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_24@... Thank you, player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_26@... May the Goddess bless you. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_27@That ends prayer time. How are you feeling today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_28@I feel better... Thank you, sister.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_29@Suddenly there is a commotion from afar, and it gradually gets closer and closer. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_3@player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_30@What's happening? It sounds like there are a lot of people...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_31@... Madam, please leave from the backdoor first. And please do watch your steps.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_32@After the believer disappears from Sora's sight, Sora switches to a cold expression. From somewhere unknown, she pulls out an SMG and stalks out of the church.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_34@You're not gone yet?! Bitch, are you ignoring our warning? Huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_35@You're the ones that should be gone!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_36@Ratatatatatatatatatatat──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_37@A rain of bullets sprays from the gun and forms a beautiful line that immediately guns down the front row of gangsters. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_38@However, there is even more people surrounding the church than last time. \nAfter the front row was defeated, the crowd became even more agitated and angry. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_39@This bitch is still being so cocky before her death!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_4@I walk towards her out of curiosity, and was shocked by the large patches of red splashed against the walls of the church.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_40@Let's put that bitch in her place!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_41@A pungent smell hits Sora's nose when she sees the gangsters dragging out barrels and barrels of gasoline from their truck. One of them even takes out a lighter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_42@Darn. They're too far away. Can I make it in time if I run out now...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_43@Whup-whup-whup...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_44@What's that sound?...\nA helicopter?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_45@Amidst the booming sound of the rotor, the door of the helicopter is slid open by a woman with a leather whip in her hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_46@Hehe~ So this is the woman you begged me to grant reinforcement for, my toy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_47@You're the one who insisted to join our plan after overhearing the conversation between Riria and me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_48@You're talking too much! You would already be dead if you're on a battlefield!\nAim at the target next to the vacant land, and, fire!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_49@The water gun modified by Rise is equipped on the helicopter, releasing a heavy steam of water that covers a wide area.\nThe high-pressure water released from such a height immediately shows its destructive power  on par with that of a real gun.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_5@Is this... paint? Did the gangsters do this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_50@This isn't good... Let's retreat for now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_51@It's the end of your gang.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_53@Before the gangsters know it, they're already surrounded by a huge troop of soldiers.\nThe helicopter flies right above them and lets down the ladder for Diana and me to climb back down to the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_54@Coach, the gangsters have been completely surrounded.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_55@Good job. And say thank you for me to your father.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_56@You... Bastard, who are you?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_57@I look at the leader of the gang and point my thumb at Sora.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_58@Her neighbor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_6@Yes. It happened just now. They asked me to stop preaching and threatened to set the church on fire if I don't leave by tomorrow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_60@That means, you're not messing around with the church, but the neighbor of our gigantic water gun team.\nAnd unfortunately, our gigantic water gun team is powerful enough to mobilize military troops.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_61@So, it would be in your best interest not to harass the church ever again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_63@The gangsters glance at the helicopter and back at the military troops, looking obviously hesitant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_64@I don't think there's anything to be so hesitant for.\nBecause if you don't make the promise, we'll have to "physically" bring you before the Goddess for some repentance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_65@... Damn it. I understand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_67@The gangsters finally walk away dejectedly.\nWhile Diana and Rira are still discussing the management afterwards with the military, I walk towards Sora.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_68@I said "leave it to me," and look, isn't the problem solved already?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_69@This is really...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_7@That's a straight declaration of crime...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_70@Sora looks surprised for a while, and eventually smiles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_71@What can I do for you in return, player?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_72@Well... How about coming to the dormitory of our water gun team from time to time and practicing gun handling skills with us?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_73@This is my real purpose... from the moment I saw Sora wielding the submachine gun, I knew I wanted her to join my team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_74@That's it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_75@Sora slowly walked towards me, with her soft body almost leaning against mine.\nSurrounded by her mysterious fragrance, I hear a clear murmur from my ear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_76@I know a place where nobody would bother us.\nHow do you think if we move there and... discuss how I should show my gratitude?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_8@I can handle a fight, but arson... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_4_9@Sora's face shows a rare expression of worry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_1@被空拉着手，我们远离嘈杂的人声，来到教堂底端。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_10@什、什么情况？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_11@这些……都是我珍藏的宝贝。\n离你最近的那一把，是我在地下黑市淘来的；还有……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_12@空兴致勃勃地弯下腰，开始介绍每一把枪枝的来历。\n她白皙的双颊透出兴奋的红晕，眼中也闪烁迷醉的光芒。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_13@（虽然这样的空比刚刚还要吸引人，但为什么我完全熄火了呢……）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_14@我在内心深切反省过自己的邪念后，深吸一口气。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_15@我说，这样真的好吗？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_16@咦？Player没兴趣吗？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_17@你说自己是水枪战队的人，我还以为你也喜欢这些呢……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_18@也不是没兴趣啦，毕竟水枪的规格有多少会参考真实枪械……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_19@……不对啦！我想说的是，把枪藏在告解室的地板下没问题吗！？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_2@然后，一个轻巧的拐弯，我跨过藏在布幔后的木门──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_20@没关系喔，\n这个机关要用一定的力道踩踏才会打开，不会被信众发现的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_21@至于持有枪械的问题……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_22@这就是我和player在告解室的小秘密了，对吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_3@这里是……告解室？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_4@是的，这里适合埋藏秘密，\n同时，也是呈现它的最佳场所……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_5@空一边说着，一边缓缓撩起修女服的下襬。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_6@白皙的小腿逐渐呈现在我眼前，我感觉到理性正在离我远去。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_7@（没想到竟然被我碰到传说中的以身相许……那我就不客气了──）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_1_9@就在我想伸手触摸时，那双曲线优美的腿迅速一跺、踏中某个机关，\n地板瞬间翻起，露出底下各式各样的枪械。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_1@好……想要啊……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_10@葛蕾丝！？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_11@我来不及制止，葛蕾丝已经掠过我身边。\n然而，就在她碰到空的前一秒──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_14@冲锋枪的枪口顶在葛蕾丝额头上，空的眼底充满冰冷的杀气。\n但在看清楚葛蕾丝后，空却愣了一下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_15@咦？妳……妳是魔魅？梦魔一族的……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_16@……看来妳不是普通人啊，竟能一眼看穿妾身的来历……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_17@砰的一声，空扣下板机；但葛蕾丝的动作更快，瞬间就窜回走廊深处、不见踪影。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_18@没想到player家有这么危险的魔物进驻……女神在上，看来我得时常过来了，还请不要见怪呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_19@妳常来我是很欢迎啦，但葛蕾丝其实也不算太危险……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_2@无法从player身上汲取精气，又不允许妾身对水枪战队的成员下手，甚至连外出猎食都……妾身已经快要枯竭了……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_20@身为女神的使徒，抚平肆虐的邪灵也是我们更接近神灵的方式……\n不用为了担心我而说出违反心意的话喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_21@啊哈哈……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_22@（看来是没办法靠言语解决了。虽然是有点想看修女和梦魔的对抗……还是先叫艾莉丝把葛蕾丝带走吧。）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_3@嗯？那个女孩……不是战队成员，却出现在宿舍……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_4@呵呵，那就休怪妾身不客气了～\n是妳闯进来的，妾身可没有违反约定喔～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_6@难得妳来参观，不要太拘束喔，当成自己家就好了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_7@谢谢你，这里很舒适呢，就像……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_8@话还没说完，一抹鬼魅的影子旋风般扑向毫无防备的空。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P025_N_2_9@妳的精气、妾身就收下了～～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_1@-Squirt Gun Training Grounds-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_10@A faint floral scent wafts over on the wind. \nI was still trying to pinpoint the source of the smell when I hear someone exclaim from behind me
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_11@Kagano?! Are you OK?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_12@Ugh... My stomach suddenly...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_13@Coach, I'll take Kagano to the bathroom!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_14@With two members on the enemy team suddenly missing, Sora puts down her weapon with a contemplative look on her face. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_15@Following her gaze, I look towards the entrance of the training ground—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_16@Sora, what are you doing in a place like this? I've been looking everywhere for you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_17@A short-haired girl completely ignores my existence and tries to barge in. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_18@Cough, cough. Excuse me, this is private property. Strangers aren't welcome to trespass. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_19@player, sorry. This is... my neighbor. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_2@Today Sora came to visit and it just happened to be the day of the team's practice match. In the heat of the moment, I took her to the brand new training ground.   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_21@Sora is my neighbor, so that means Sora's neighbor is also my neighbor... like hell she is!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_22@I've never seen this swimsuit wearing girl before. Sora, are you sure that you haven't mistaken her for someone else?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_23@To be more specific, Angel is my ex-neighbor... She helped me out a ton when the local gang was still out to get me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_25@Ex~actly! \nI'm in a good mood today, so I'll forgive your insolence. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_26@What?! Did you say that YOU will forgive ME?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_27@Who else could it be. Calling haute couture a "swimsuit"... \nIf this isn't insolence, then what is?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_28@Haute couture...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_29@I take a dubious look at Angel's clothes. Upon closer inspection, there is indeed a minor difference. \nUnder the sunlight, there is a faint dark gold streak that flashes over the cloth.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_3@This is a once in a lifetime chance, do you want to try competing?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_30@Oh wow, this fabric... is made from a nearly lost weaving technique. I've only seen something similar once while attending an auction with my father. Never did I think I would see it here. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_31@Hehe, at least there is still someone that isn't completely blind!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_32@Are you serious... \nCould this person actually be the daughter of some rich family?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_33@That's amazing. Did you find this in the garbage dump too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_34@Garbage... what?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_35@Angel ignores my baffled face and nods proudly. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_36@I found this in the drawer of a wooden chest. It was old and dingy, but I could tell straight away that the box was used by rich people for storage. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_37@There is a hidden compartment in these chests. \nIt's a great place to hide your treasure, but people often forget to check the chest before throwing it out. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_38@In other words, if you see a chest like that in a garbage dump, there's a high chance that you'll find treasure within. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_39@So there isn't just trash in a garbage dump...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_4@Eh? Me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_40@Of course! There's more treasure than you expect~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_41@Although, you still find other useless stuff... Just two days ago I found a reconnaissance drone, but couldn't turn it on no matter what. It seems that I still need to spend some time to work out the technical difficulties...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_42@Angel folds her arms in front of her chest and trails off in thought. \nI finally recover from the barrage of information that she was throwing my way. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_43@Alright, we all know that you go dumpster diving. \nCan you tell us why you're trespassing now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_44@Oops, I would have completely forgotten if you didn't bring it up. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_45@Sora, I've recently heard that the "view" by the seaside is stunning. Do you want to come check it out with me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_46@I'm not sure if it's just my imagination, but the "view" that Angel is talking about seems to have a different meaning. \nBefore I can think too much, Angel waves her hand. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_47@That's it~ Sorry for interrupting. \nGoodbye, Mr. Insolence~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_48@... She really left just like that. What a rude girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_49@Hehe, Angel isn't afraid to speak her mind. That's what I admire about her. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_5@Yeah, just treat it as a friendly competition on gun handling skills. No pressure. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_50@Ahh... sorry. I'm not trying to badmouth your friend. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_51@That's OK, I can understand what player is feeling. \nI hope that there will be a chance in the future for you both to get to know each other better. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_52@Well, if there's a chance...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_53@Also...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_54@In the distance, Kagano and Yui are returning to the field. \nSora gives them a weird look. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_55@Please offer my apologies to Miss Kagano. I hope that her body is alright. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_56@Apologize? What for...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_57@Sora shakes her head and doesn't let me continue to ask. She makes her leave and chases after Angel. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_58@What's going on today? Such odd things are happening one after another...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_59@Whatever... I should bring everyone back to the dorm first. I'll get to the bottom of things later. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_6@Well... if you say so.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_8@As expected, Sora was no stranger to using firearms and easily keeps up with the pace of battle. \nUnfortunately, she didn't understand tactics so her opponents gradually gain the upper hand during the course of the battle. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_1_9@The outcome of the battle should be decided soon... \nHmm? What's that smell?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_1@Over the past couple of days, the street the dormitory is located on has been filled with the sound of construction. My sanity is nearing its limit as I am constantly bombarded with a cacophony of sound. I suddenly think back to the incident a few days back. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_10@Now this is living the life...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_11@Not wanting to be found by my team, I choose a discrete spot behind some potted plants. Not only am I hidden from sight, but I can also see the only route to the pub. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_12@As a result, when two suspicious figures sneaked toward the pub I was able to notice them right away. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_13@What are they doing? It looks like they're taking something out from their fanny packs and stuffing it in their shirts... Uh, could it be guns? Are they robbers?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_14@I struggle to sit up upon that thought. Under the cover of the plants, I see them push open the door, enter the pub, and sit down right next to me—on the other side of the plants. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_15@The two seemed inconspicuous, but the moment they opened their mouths, they reperked my interest. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_16@Hey, you have "that" securely put away, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_17@Of course!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_18@Sigh... if our communication wasn't tapped we wouldn't have to come out here—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_19@Would it kill you to shut up?! There's a time and place for everything!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_20@The two look about nervously as I shrink behind the potted plants. \nBy the time I cautiously raise my head again, they are already having a low rapid conversation huddled together.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_21@(Dang it, I can't hear what they're saying... Now that I think about it, their faces look a little familiar. Where have I seen them before?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_22@As I was struggling to place them in my mind, a faint floral scent mingles with the smell of cigarette smoke in the pub. \nNext, a slim figure appears in front of my eyes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_23@Dear customers, here are your cocktails: Guaranteed Hit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_24@(Wait, Angel?! Is she a waitress here?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_25@Hmm? We didn't order these. I think you have the wrong table.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_26@Hehe~ This is on the house! You two just happened to be today's 10th customer! \nThe event rules are on the sign by the entrance, see~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_27@The two people turn their heads towards the entrance of the pub where Angel is pointing. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_28@In that moment, I see Angel's hand pass over the rim of the cocktails and a pink powder falls into the drinks. The floral scent that was just barely noticeable suddenly becomes much stronger. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_29@(...! Could it be—)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_30@As the two turn their heads back, the smell of flowers has already dissipated. They impatiently wave away Angel. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_31@I don't see a thing! \nAnyways, say thanks to the owner for me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_32@No worries~ Please enjoy~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_33@As Angel turns and is about to walk away, she passes by the plants. My hand shoots out, quick as lightning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_35@I cover her mouth just in time, so she is unable to let out a scream. \nThe sound of laughter comes from the other side of the plants.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_36@Nice, freebies! Even the name of the drinks is a good sign!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_37@Enough talk, cheers!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_38@Whew, that hits the spot—Eh?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_39@My s-stomach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_40@... I need to go to the bathroom real quick!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_41@M-Me too—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_42@Amidst the sound of chairs scraping against the floor, the two swiftly rush towards the restroom and leave behind their fanny packs. I look down at Angel who I have in a grip around her wrists. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_43@I start to connect the dots... the smell of flowers, stomach aches, and what I just witnessed.... I frown at Angel. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_44@You! You poisoned my team members when Sora came to visit, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_45@I thought that Angel would be more flustered after being caught red-handed, but she suprisingly just looked at me as if she has something on her mind.   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_46@What else was I supposed to do? Let them pick on Sora? How dare they be so serious when going against a newbie. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_48@I see... So she was trying to help Sora?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_49@—Wait, that's not the problem! Isn't poisoning someone way too extreme?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_5@The seaside...? I recall that there is also a league training facility there. I might as well take a vacation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_50@What's so extreme about a stomach ache...? We really don't mesh, I don't want to say another word to you. I'm going to go— 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_51@No way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_52@I grab Angel's wrist. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_53@I can sort of understand what you did to my teammates, but how do you explain those two people just then? \nDon't tell me that you did it just because they looked like easy targets?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_54@So what if that's the case?! Let go of me this instance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_55@Sensing Angel's restlessness and seeing her gaze focus on the fanny packs left on the table, I suddenly understand and hold on even tighter. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_56@I thought you were just a dumpster diver. I never pegged you to be a thief—Woah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_57@I was almost unable to keep hold as Angel suddenly struggles fiercely. \nSeeing her failed escape attempt, Angel kicks out at me in anger. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_58@Let go of me, you idiot! I'm about to let my treasure get away!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_7@Just like that, I bring the team to the seaside. After training, I go to a small pub by the sea to relax alone. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_8@The sun, scorching wind, and waves crashing upon the beach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_2_9@I take a gulp of cold refreshing beer and lie with arms and feet spread out on the pub's beach chair. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_1@Angel escapes from my grip as I was still in a daze. \nAs she comes out from behind the plants and reaches out to the table, two exhausted figures return. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_10@She seems to be even more full of energy as the wind ruffles her short hair. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_11@To put it simply, those two have something that belongs to me. In order to get it back, I had to resort to this.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_12@Oh... so you're saying you're just trying to take back what they stole from you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_13@Of course not. Do I look like someone that's so easily stolen from?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_14@Eh? But you just said that they have something of yours...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_15@Well it's going to be mine sooner or later. So of course it can be considered as my property.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_16@... So you just wanted to steal after all! Your morals are completely out of whack! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_17@As if reading my mind, Angel pouts her mouth. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_18@You don't understand a thing! This is the spirit of a treasure hunter. Do you understand? The spirit!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_19@I've heard that someone hid treasure along this coastline and drew a map pointing to its location. I tracked it down and finally confirmed that the map is in these two people's hands. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_2@... Tsk. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_20@In other words, as long as you have that map the treasure is as good as yours! I am a treasure hunter that is willing to go over mountain and under seas to find that treasure~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_21@I can't help speaking up after seeing Angel's proud face. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_22@Well... aren't treasures just a thing of fantasy? This is the real world that we're living in. R, E, A, L, do you know what that word means? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_23@I—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_24@Furthermore, no matter how you look at it... poisoning and stealing seem like things a bad person would do. What does that have to do with being a treasure hunter?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_25@So what?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_26@Angel shrugs her shoulder with a seemingly calm expression on her face, but underneath the facade you can see her arrogant and unyielding nature. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_27@When the rich burn through their money, they don't think about the people starving on the streets. I'm just taking an insignificant amount to them and trying to save those people that don't deserve to die. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_28@Those two aren't good people anyways. Before Sora moved to this city, they had harassed her for a whole year! They picked on her just because she provided emotional support to the needy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_29@... I see.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_3@Angel pulls back her hand reluctantly and returns to my side. Her gaze is full of resentment. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_30@No wonder I thought I knew those two from somewhere. So they are from the gang that was in a dispute with Sora. It all makes sense now. Also...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_31@Thinking back to their actions on the way to the pub as they took something out from their fanny packs and stuffed it in their shirt, it all makes sense now as I conect all the information. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_32@I understand your motive and goal now, but the only thing I still can't accept is your methods. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_33@Ahh? Did your mom drop you on your head when you were young? As long as I can reach my goal, I'm willing to—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_34@Even if it won't work?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_35@... What do you mean?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_36@You... poisoned them so that the fanny packs would be left defenceless. There's nothing wrong with this logic, but have you ever thought what if the map wasn't in them from the first place? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_37@No... that's impossible! I saw them put it inside!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_38@Where did you see it? If even you can receive word of the "treasure," won't they also know beforehand to be more cautious? Won't they take precautions?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_39@... What do I do? I can't just go and search them. My poison doesn't knock people out. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_4@You let slip such a perfect opportunity! How are you going to make it up to me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_40@Hmphh, you're in luck. I just happen to know where they hid the map. Even better, coming up with plans just happens to be my strong suite. Why don't you try listening to my command?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_42@Fine. I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself. Alright, what do you want to do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_43@First... I remember that you said you found a reconnaissance drone, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_45@Are you ready?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_46@Will this really work...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_47@You don't have to worry about me. Just make sure that you don't mess up... You're the key to this plan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_48@... Don't look down on me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_49@Ok. \nReady when you are. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_5@Before we go into more details, do you want to explain just what is going on here...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_51@After paying their bill at the counter, the two gang members walk out of the pub. \nI calculate their route and press a button—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_52@Whew, that's enough rest. Time to get back to work now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_53@What do you mean rest? My asshole is still burning from all that explosive diarrhea... When I get my money, I'm definitely going to go splurging. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_54@Alright... Hmm? What's that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_55@A small drone drops from the sky amid a low buzzing sound and stops when it is directly above the two gangsters heads. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_56@—At the bottom of the drone, bright white energy particles begin to coalesce.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_57@What the heck—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_58@Get out of the way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_59@After charging up, a laser beam shoots down and grazes one of the gangsters nose. \nIn his haste to back away from the path of the laser, he stumbles and falls backwards on his ass— 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_6@Hah... You're right, I should let you know what a serious mistake you have made. I don't think you will be able to understand the severity. I guess it can't be helped. Follow me.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_60@Dear customer, are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_61@Angel catches the fall of the gangster and even uses one hand to provide support against his chest. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_62@I don't miss the instant when Angel stealthily removes a piece of paper from inside of the gangster's clothes as he falls against Angel's chest. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_63@... Alright, next, let's meet up at the rendezvous point. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_64@I don't stay behind to see how Angel takes care of the situation and send a signal to the drone to retreat.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_7@Angel stands up and walks out to the pub balcony. \nI follow her subconsciously. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_3_9@The sand kicked up by the wind hurts as it hits my face, but Angel doesn't seem to mind at all and leans against the railing. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_1@After five minutes, Angel runs out nimbly from behind a rock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_10@The torn and yellowed paper looks pretty ancient. The surrounding landscape is simply drawn, with an obviously large cross.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_11@I raise my head. The spot with the cross is a jagged coastline, with numerous caves of different sizes by the sea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_12@Treasure in a seaside cave? How logical...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_13@There's no scale on the map, so we can only search by ourselves. And now it's time to bring out my tiny partner~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_14@... Why can you just magically make a compass appear out of thin air? Is it something normal people always bring with them?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_15@It's a must-have for a treasure hunter. Newbie just has to shut up and watch! Alright! Set sail~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_17@The sun soon sets onto the surface of the sea as I search the area with Angel while bantering with her. As the unexplored regions grow ever smaller, Angel grows more and more excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_18@Are we there yet~? I bet we're close~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_19@She's singing now... Just look how happy she is.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_2@Hehe, I got it. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_20@Affected by Angel's mood, I also feel relaxed.\nBut that's only before I hear the footsteps.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_21@Without any time to explain to her, I pull Angel into a space beneath a rock.\nTo avoid her making any noise because of my sudden action, I cover her mouth with my hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_22@Shh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_23@As the footfall approaches, a male voice appeares from right above us. Seems like the man is standing right on the rock we're hiding beneath.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_24@... There's no one here? Was my eye playing tricks?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_25@We're making the trade today, so be extra careful.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_26@Sure. I'll go around to check again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_27@The footsteps gradually leave us.\nI lower my head, and see that Angel has her whole body almost entirely against me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_28@The faint fragrance of flower fills the narrow space while two warm soft lips touch my palm, and the moist breath let out from between...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_29@(Woah...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_3@You fixed the drone and made this plan... I didn't expect you to be so dependable. I'm really impressed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_30@Just when I was completely distracted, Angel suddenly straightens up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_31@There are even people on guard here... Looks like this is the spot. But how are we going to distract them... player?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_32@Cough...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_33@I look at Angel's excited face, trying to regain my composure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_34@If that's the case, how about using the drone?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_36@From far away, the laser beam looks dazzling beneath the dusk sky.\nNumerous ruffians dash out from among the rocks and rush towards the laser beam while shouting all the way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_37@After they went further into the distance, Angel and I peek our heads out from the rock we were hiding underneath.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_38@Ha! We've tricked them all! Now's the time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_39@We swiftly sneak into the cave that had the most guards and turn on our flashlights.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_4@That's because you underestimated me too much before! You're talking to the master of strategy, as well as the equipment fixer in our squirt gun team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_40@The light from modern technology soon illuminates the whole cave, showing tens of wooden boxes piled up at a corner.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_41@There really is something! Awesome! Then I'll help myself~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_42@Angel pounces onto one of the boxes and opens the lid of it.\nHowever, we're both stupefied when we see what's inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_43@This... Is this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_44@... This is amazing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_45@It's not the time to appreciate it!\nWhy... is it filled with condoms?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_46@The box is filled to the brim with condoms. \nWe open another box, and see the same exact thing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_47@This one... and that one also... Damn! Where's the treasure?! Where did my treasure go?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_48@Well, this should be the so-called treasure, I guess...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_49@What kind of person considers condoms treasure?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_5@Alright~ Alright~ You're such a great man. \nThen do you want to be my temporary partner and go hunting for the treasure with me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_50@While Angel is going nuts, a trivial piece of information comes to my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_51@Now that I recall, there have been several building constructions on the street near the dorm. I heard that all of them were for building hotels. Rumor has it that the owner of that street is from some special background, and that he always conducts his business while skirting the law...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_52@If the hotels there are for sex establishments, then these condoms might be the products for it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_53@And the two people with the map once said they were "tapped"... So logically speaking, they might be using a map to relay the trading spot because the police are keeping an eye on them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_54@To sum up, there wasn't any treasure from the beginning. It's merely a secret trade under the table.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_56@Just as Angel was about to say something, we hear people approaching from the outside.\nWe look at each other and immediately turn off the flashlights, fleeing out of the cave sneakily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_58@Ah, Hah~ Darn it. I didn't see that coming~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_59@Sitting by the edge of the cave, Angel mumbles while stretching her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_6@Angel proudly waves her fingers with a torn piece of paper in between them. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_60@After escaping from the condom cave, we took a while to bypass the gangsters patrolling the caves by weaving around the coast. So now we're taking a small break at this cave by the sea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_61@It looks like the sun is dipping into the sea and staining the water red.\nSeeing how open-hearted Angel still looks despite her pursed lips, I can't help asking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_62@Don't you think it's totally a waste of time to get nothing after so much effort?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_63@Hm? Well, I do feel a little upset, but it's worth it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_64@When Angel turns around to look at me, the burning red landscape immediately becomes her background.\nShe smiles brightly as the golden sunlight sparkles around her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_65@In some perspective, a partner to experience adventures and conquer obstacles is much rarer than any kind of treasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_66@Oh, oh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_67@Such a straight confession makes my heart skip a beat. For some reason, I suddenly recall how soft Angel's lips were when I touched them with my palm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_68@At the same time, just like she's reading my mind, Angel raises her hand and lands her slender fingers on her plump breasts, sliding them into the valley in between.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_69@However, it would be better if I can really get something.\nSpeaking of which, don't you think the scenery here is perfect for people to do something pleasant... player?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_7@Now that I've come so far, it would be mean if you don't include me! Let's see the map now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_70@How about... let's make a wonderful memory here together?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_8@Haha, the man who has been making fun of me living in a fictional world now looks so excited himself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_4_9@Angel mocks me while spreading the map.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_10@就说这不是泳衣──唉唷，磨磨蹭蹭的，你到底是不是男人啊？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_11@……怀疑的话，妳自己来鉴定一下啊！？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_12@我跳下海，迅速游近安洁儿。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_13@哈，你追得上我再说！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_14@安洁儿溜过我擒抱的臂弯，修长的腿在我的胸口轻轻一蹬，箭一般地窜飞出去。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_15@被她撩拨起斗志，我跟在她后头、沿着海岸向前游去──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_17@游了一会，原本紧密的岩岸逐渐稀疏。\n安洁儿张望了一会，很快锁定目标。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_18@找到了！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_19@──喔喔，真漂亮啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_2@话刚说完，安洁儿就站起身。\n接着，在我以为她要朝我走来时，转头噗通一声跳进海中。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_20@这里原本应该是个海蚀洞，但因为长期侵蚀，洞顶已经坍了，可以看见整片的天空；剩下的岩石则形成天然的拱门，并围出一圈水域。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_21@不觉得很像皇帝的浴池吗？没想到实景比网络上的照片更壮观呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_22@咦？看妳熟门熟路的，我还以为妳早就来过了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_23@因为我一直想着要跟伙伴一起来啊，只是之前没有合适的对象。\n还好今天遇到你了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_24@在这边休息一下，为今天画下完美的句点吧，伙伴！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_25@哈哈，伙伴吗……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_26@我靠在岩石边，和安洁儿一起泡在水中看着、落日逐渐下沉。\n同时，内心有个小小的计划正在酝酿……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_3@……！？\n妳干嘛──噗喔！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_4@趁我说话，安洁儿把海水泼到我脸上。\n我的口中瞬间一片又苦又咸的味道。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_5@呸呸呸呸──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_6@哈哈哈，你反应很慢耶！快点下来啦，我带你去看个东西。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_7@啊？现在？我身上穿的不是泳裤耶。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_8@有什么关系，我也不是穿泳衣啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_1_9@妳身上那件还不够像泳衣吗……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_1@─夜晚的营火边─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_10@嬉笑的声音在营火边缭绕，我一时插不上话，只能默默在一边喝酒。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_11@女生真了不起啊，一下子就能聊成一片，明明只是第一次见面……不对，严格说起来应该是第二次……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_12@就在我胡思乱想的时候，火堆旁的话题不知道为什么转到各自的家庭背景。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_13@……我的爸爸妈妈……人很好……呼……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_14@灯歌？糟糕，太温暖所以睡着了吗？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_15@噗哈哈，太厉害了吧，这样也能睡？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_16@别管她了，帮她盖件外套就好。\n那妳呢，安洁儿？妳们家从事什么行业？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_17@喔，捡回收的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_18@笑语瞬间静默了一秒，只剩下火堆劈啪炸裂的声音。\n安洁儿像是没注意到似的继续开口。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_19@我从小就跟爸妈在垃圾场穿梭，把能卖钱的东西挑出来，不知不觉就把眼力锻炼出来了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_2@欢迎新朋友──安洁儿！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_20@妳身上这套衣服就是最好的例子吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_21@一直温柔倾听的空打破沉默。安洁儿得意地咧嘴。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_22@是啊。这个能力超级有用，去逛摊贩都能淘出好东西、用低价买下来呢！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_23@听起来好方便啊……要是有机会跟安洁儿一起逛街就好了，一定会很开心。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_24@我刚刚看到前面有个夜间市集，等一下可以去看看。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_25@真的？有卖哪些东西啊？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_26@我记得……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_27@喧嚣又重新笼罩火堆旁，甚至比烈焰更加炽热。\n我静静倾听女孩们聊天的内容，微微一笑。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_28@（太好了，赶快互相熟悉吧。只要有交情，就有机会把安洁儿也拖上赛场了！）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_29@（安洁儿可以获得伙伴，我也获得一个手脚灵活的优秀人力……真是完美的双赢策略，不愧是我！呵呵呵～）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_3@请多指教～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_4@哈哈，好多人啊。妳们都是什么战队的队员吗？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_5@嗯，大家都为了胜利在努力喔！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_6@妳也是！？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_7@没想到妳这么娇小的人也能成为战士，这只队伍还真有意思啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_8@不太算战士啦……不过，我会用我的长处支持大家的！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P026_N_2_9@真不错的气魄！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_01@Hmm... What do I do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_02@As soon as I open the door, I see Nadeshiko looking bothered with her head resting on her hand, so I walk towards her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_03@What's the matter? It's not every day that I can see you frowning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_04@Ah! player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_05@It's okay. I'll handle it... So sorry for embarrassing myself in front of you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_06@Nadeshiko... Am I really that unreliable?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_07@What?! No...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_08@The thank-you festival and press conference the committee is holding recently must have made you extremely busy.\nThe competition is off now, so I do have plenty of time to help you out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_09@Sigh... It's really not a big deal. It's just that I got a call from the delivery company saying that there was something wrong with the shipping, so they couldn't send the flowers the committee's using here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_10@I remember you ordered them from a flower shop, right? Like hundreds of baskets... The huge number was pretty impressive when I saw the purchase order.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_11@Yes. Though the owner of the flower shop said that she could send it here in person...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_12@Seeing how hesitant Nadeshiko is, I pat her shoulder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_13@Alright. Since you said it's not a big deal and I don't have anything else to do, let me be Miss Nadeshiko's assistant today and check on the flower shop for you. How do you say? I'll try not to mess it up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_14@I start to act extremely cautious, making Nadeshiko burst into laughter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_15@You're totally exaggerating. But if it's really not too troublesome for you, please go check on that girl for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_16@That girl...? You mean the owner of that flower shop?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_17@Despite my confusion, I take the business card from Nadeshiko, sneakily kiss her cheek, and leave the office.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_19@I walk into an alley according to the address. A truck parked in front of the shop full of blooming plants is vrooming in the quiet neighborhood.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_20@I bet it's here. And the baskets on the truck should be Nadeshiko's order.\nThe owner is called... Saku? Where is she?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_21@I reach my head into the shop and see a silhouette in the depth of the shop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_22@Um... So now that all the products are here, I should first sort the seeds...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_23@Woah! Is she the owner? How cute...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_24@Bang! Clang, Clang──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_25@Ouch!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_26@When Saku was walking, she didn't notice that her clothes were hooked by a branch and thus pulled a whole row of flower pots onto the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_27@She wanted to push them back, but for an unknown reason, Saku pulled back her hands and lost her balance, ending up falling down with the flower pots.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_28@Sob... I'll have to re-arrange them...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_29@With her lips pursed, Saku pats her knees and stands up. But she accidentally bumps into the table in front of her and flips all over, scattering all the tools on it to the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_30@Aah, crap!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_31@She rushes to the tools but kicks the bucket away in the air, making the whole store soaking wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_32@Seeing how she tries to fix things but in vain, my feeling for her has already changed from amazement to speechlessness.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_33@No wonder Nadeshiko looked so worried... She is way too clumsy!\nWho on earth wouldn't be worried having her sending the flowers...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_34@I sigh in my mind as I roll up my sleeves, ready to get in and help with the cleaning.\nYet the telephone in the shop rings unexpectedly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_35@Hello?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_36@... You're coming for your order now? Sure!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_37@Eh? You're coming from the backdoor?... Sure. No problem... Please wait for a while then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_38@After hanging up the phone, Saku takes a deep breath and looks around nervously.\nI shrink my body back behind the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_39@... Why am I hiding?! Tsk, it must be because I've peeked into the girls' dressing room too many times...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_40@Reaching my head out again, I see Saku stops looking around and now standing in front of a flower pot that is taller than her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_41@I guess she should get a trolley? That pot looks too heavy... What?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_42@From what I'm seeing... Saku grabs the edge of the pot and carries it up with only one hand.\nThen, she turns around and leaves.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_43@So the pot just "looked" heavy, huh? It does make some sense not that people like to cut the budgets on everything. So it must be normal to use some plastic pots that look like ceramic ones.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_44@And... I guess that shallow hole on the ground wasn't created by the weight of the vase, right?\nHa, haha... ha...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_45@... Maybe I should follow her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_1_46@Following behind Saku, I pad through the mess in the shop to the backdoor of the shop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_01@There's a small garden surrounded by fence behind the flower shop, with a wooden door towards the street.\nSaku places the flower pot onto the ground and opens the door, looking around.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_02@Yet after a while, there isn't anyone there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_03@Hm? I thought he said he had already arrived. If I spend too much time here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_04@Saku turns around to check the clock on the wall with worry.\nAt this moment, a frivolous laughter comes from outside the fence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_05@Ha, you're really here? Hey, beauty, I'm here~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_06@A man leaning against the fence says.\nAfter Saku sees him, he steps into the garden and walks towards her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_07@You're such a good girl, coming to the backdoor just because I asked you to, just like an obedient puppy~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_09@Did I shock you? Hahaha, don't be afraid. I'm just looking for an obedient girl.\nAnd I think you're the one!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_10@... Sorry. I don't quite understand...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_11@Oh, that's adorable. How obedient! You're perfect!\nHow do you think? Wanna be my puppy? I'll take good care of you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_12@The man says while reaching his hand out to rub Saku's hair.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_13@Ugh...! Please stop it, or...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_14@Or what? Hm? You'll get punished if you don't listen to your owner!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_15@The man starts to unbuckle his pants with a twisted smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_16@What's wrong with this man?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_17@Just when I decide to stop peeking and go to help Saku, she grabs the watering can next to her──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_18@──Please forgive my rudeness!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_19@As soon as the liquid in the watering can is splashed onto the vine beside Saku, it starts to grow frantically.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_20@After growing to the width of around ten people's open arms within a second, the vine, as if with its consciousness, reaches towards the man──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_21@Wuaaaaaaghh! Mo-Monster!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_22@When the man scrambles away from the garden, his legs get tangled by the vines, and eventually his unbuckled pants are completely torn down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_23@I'm s-so sorry!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_24@After seeing the screaming man fleeing with his butt naked, Saku puts down the watering can in relief.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_25@Clank!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_26@Wh-Who is that?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_27@I put back the bottles I accidentally bumped into due to the shock and walk out of the shop with both of my hands in the air.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_28@I walked in here because I didn't see anyone from the door...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_29@While talking, I glance at the vine that grew tremendously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_30@... What?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_31@The plant that looked like a behemoth has disappeared to nowhere. Now only a broken pot, splattered dirt, and a petite vine rooting on a clod are left on the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_32@Ah... Well... I happened to break the flower pot, so...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_33@(It seems like she doesn't want anyone to know what just happened...\nI'll try to ask her after making some bond.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_34@Ahaha, I break things a lot when I'm nervous, too.\nWould you like me to help you clean it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_35@It's okay. Just leave it there.\nI still have to deliver flowers for a customer... so I might not be able to greet you well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_36@Well... Actually, I'm coming for Miss Nadeshiko.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_37@What?!\nI'm so sorry. Is it because I haven't sent the flower there, Miss Nadeshiko...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_38@It's nothing like that. Don't worry.\nI'm here to help only because I really don't have anything else to do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_40@As Saku looks more relieved, I walk towards the giant pot she just carried to the backyard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_41@I don't think that guy needs this pot anymore, so I'll take it inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_42@Ah, wait──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_43@Before Saku can stop me, I've already bent down, trying to carry it with a single hand in a cool way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_44@──But the flower pot is still standing there, without moving an inch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_45@... Hold on... So this pot is this heavy?!\nThen how did you carry it with only a hand...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_46@Wait, what? You saw it?! \nDoes that mean you also saw what happens afterwards...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_47@Oops, I let it slip.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_48@With no excuse, I nod silently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_49@──Wuuohh?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_50@Saku suddenly grips my wrist and drags me into the flower shop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_51@The soft tiny hand and the feminine fragrance... These trivia are supposed to be tempting, but I could care less about them now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_52@Only because...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_2_53@(She's way too powerful! \nI think she's dislocating my arm wuooooohh~~!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_01@After returning to the flower shop, Saku closes the front door, hangs a "Closed" sign up on it, and walks back to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_02@Um... Sorry about that. Is your arm okay? I was too nervous to control my power...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_03@It's still connected to my shoulder, so I guess that's... okay...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_04@Though it did almost become dismantlable...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_05@Sob... I'm really sorry about it... How about I ma-make you a cup of tea?\nBut please, could you not tell anyone about what you just saw?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_06@I don't think I can answer you right now when my arm still feels so painful...\nLet's just have a cup of tea and talk about it later.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_07@Just like what I always do, I try to joke around, but Saku nodded as if suddenly realizing something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_08@You're right. I'm being too selfish here.\nPlease forgive me. I'll be back in a minute.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_09@Hey, I didn't mean anything like that── Hold on. Where are you getting the tea from?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_10@Saku smiles passionately as I stare at the watering can in her hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_11@This is the drink I invented. It was only made to grow the plants, but I soon found that it had a nice impact on human bodies as well! So that's sort of a windfall~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_12@Do you really think I didn't see anything there? I saw that liquid making those vines into a behemoth!\nAnd now you're telling me it has the same work on humans?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_13@I'll dilute it, so don't worry.\nNot to mention we humans are not plants.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_14@Saku states her theory and places a glass of liquid with a faint fragrance in front of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_15@(... Fine. It's not like I've never eaten weird things before. I guess my stomach and make it through this... Moreover, it's guilt to disappoint a girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_16@I pick up the glass and take a sip.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_17@Oh? It tastes pretty good. And...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_18@A numb and tingly feeling suddenly climbs through my shoulder and significantly eased the painful part there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_19@It really works!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_21@Then... could you reconsider now? About my secret...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_22@Well, I was going to keep your secret from the very beginning. I guess nobody will buy it when I say plants would suddenly grow, so you don't have to worry about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_23@As for you carrying that pot with a single hand... I have a member who can fight a bear with bare hands, so now that I think about your power, it's actually no big deal. I shouldn't have made a fuss over that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_24@Really?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_25@So there is someone like me... I wonder if she's living a good life.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_26@Hm? As a young and cute-looking owner of a flower shop, I bet you usually get harassed by someone like that guy before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_27@But with your tremendous power and this potion to make plants berserk, I don't think you would live a bad life...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_28@Ah, it's not like that. I'm living pretty well! I mean it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_29@I feel happy to inherit this flower shop from granny and live a safe life.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_30@So this is your grandmother's shop. Is she retired now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_31@A sadness flashes through Saku's eyes, but soon she returns to the energetic look.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_32@Yes. She's retired and now resting in heaven.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_33@Ah... I'm sorry to hear that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_34@It's fine. Even though I feel a little bit lonely without granny, I still have the best gift she left for me, which is this flower shop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_35@(Lonely? Could it be that her parents have also...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_36@I dare not ask any more question that might worsen the atmosphere, so I pretend to be relaxed and nod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_37@There seem to be some stories in this flower shop.\nBut I also want to know more about you. Could you tell me more about yourself?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_38@M-Me? Actually... there's nothing worthing sharing about me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_39@But now that we have plenty of time while delivering the flowers to our dorm, we can chitchat on the way.\nI would also like to know how you created the potion that makes plants berserk and heals human bodies.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_40@So you're also interested in plants? I'm more than willing to share if you don't mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_41@When it comes to plants, Saku's eyes glow with passion. She and I then walk towards her truck filled with flowers while chatting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_43@After delivering the flowers to Nadeshiko, I walk Saku out of the dorm.\nAs an audience of the Water Gun Competition, Saku keeps looking around in excitement, while I'm kinda spacing out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_44@(Sigh, Nadeshiko wanted me to go to the flower shop not only because she was worried about Saku messing things up... I guess she's really caring about this girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_45@Our chitchat on the way to the dorm gave me a clear picture of Saku's family background.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_46@Though her parents are still living, they're not living together anymore.\nWhat's worse, when they got divorced, neither of them wanted Saku's custody.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_47@Since I accidentally break furniture a lot due to my excessive power... and that catch negative attention from others, too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_48@My parents weren't living an easy life, so I didn't blame them at all.\nIn addition, because they didn't want me, I could live with granny!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_49@Saku's sincere and positive smile when she said so suddenly comes to my mind, bringing me the desire to take good care of this girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_50@(How could fate take away the only relative of such a great girl so early... She deserves way more love and care.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_51@(... Hm? Right!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_52@Saku.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_3_54@If you're not rushing back to the flower shop, I would like to show you a place.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_01@So this is the training court of the water gun team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_02@Yes, and all these girls are members of my team.\nLook, that girl practicing shooting is the girl who can fight with a bear as I said.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_03@Well, is it okay for us to just barge into here? It should be an important place for the team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_04@Hm? Didn't I tell you? I am──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_06@Noticing we're looking at her, Riria puts down her gun and runs towards Saku and me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_07@What? You're the coach of this water gun team?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_08@Don't I look like one?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_09@Saku nods bashfully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_10@Because... normal teams won't ask their coach to do the chores... like delivering flowers or something...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_11@Hehe, Coach is really helpful, so this is pretty normal in our team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_12@I agree. player is a great guy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_13@Though he can be a troublemaker sometimes when he just goes missing when we want to find him
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_14@There's no competition recently! You should be training by yourselves, so why would you want to find me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_15@Saki and Rise created a new weapon, but they don't know what to do with it because it's too heavy. So they're hoping that you can go and take a look.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_16@A weapon that's too heavy...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_17@An idea flashes to my mind. I look at Saku.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_18@Saku, as I remember, while we were chatting just now, you said you would like to battle with water guns when there was a chance... didn't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_20@M-Me?! Can I really do that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_21@Saku looks in over her head as she holds the weapon that is "too heavy for anyone to pick up."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_22@Instead of saying whether you're qualified enough or not... I can only say that this gun is totally designed for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_23@That's right. We used an alloy with a higher density this time to enhance the weapon's function. However, we neglected the fact that this kind of weight can't really be handled by any one of us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_24@Ah... Enough of the chemistry theories. \nAnyway, I bet this weight is just like a feather for you, huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_25@Yes... I can handle it smoothly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_26@Then you don't have to worry about anything. Go play a match with the members.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_30@I stand by the court, checking how the members and Saku are playing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_31@After a few games, Saku's moves become smoother and smoother. And she's bonding with the girls as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_32@That's nice. This flower-like smile should really be kept as a treasure with a camera.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_33@With satisfaction, I make a camera frame with my hands, following Saku's smiling face on the court.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_34@Out of the blue, I hear a strange noise.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_35@It's coming from there... Is it the training machine that shoots the water?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_36@Weird. This game is already over, so it should be off by now. How is it making such a noise...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_37@Just when I reach my head out to observe it, the power button starts to flash nonstop.\nAnd with discordant electric noise, the machine begins to spin all around.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_38@──All of you, drop to the floor!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_39@Under such an emergency, I can only shout to them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_40@No matter how confused they are, the members, who are used to taking my orders, still lie to the ground immediately.\nHowever, Saku just looks at me without any clue.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_41@While spinning wildly, the training machine behind Saku shoots out water that is way stronger than normal.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_42@Damn!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_43@Knowing that another order won't help her in time, I dash towards Saku, surround her with my arms, and swiftly turn around, blocking the rampaging water for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_44@──Wuugh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_45@The impact that is much stronger than I've expected forces me to totter a little bit. Eventually, I can't support myself anymore and can't help kneeling down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_47@Saku!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_48@The members soon turn off the training machine and rush to us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_49@Saku, are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_50@I'm fine... What about you, player?\nSorry... It's all because of my slow reaction...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_51@Don't worry. It's just water. But...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_52@The water was so strong that despite my protection, Saku still got soaking wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_53@There's a dressing room back there. You two should take off these wet clothes now, or you'll get a cold.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_54@I've brought some spare clothes. Saku can put them on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_57@After taking Saku to the dressing room, I'm about to leave. However, Saku pulls my arms back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_58@Saku...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_59@With her head lowered, Saku wraps her arms around mine tightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_60@While some affectionate atmosphere steams out from the wet clothes clung to our hot bodies, I can feel my arm enveloped by something soft.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_61@(... Crap... Now that Saku's soaking wet, her clothes look pretty transparent...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_63@Saku raises her head, showing me her face blushing with bashfulness, and whispers,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_64@I was protected by you. It feels... pretty strange...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_4_65@How am I supposed to... thank you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_02@请进。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_03@打扰了……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_04@咲？不是前几天还在发烧吗，怎么跑过来了？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_05@我才想着要去探望妳呢。对不起，要不是我们的训练仪器坏掉，妳也不会感冒……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_06@不要紧的，我已经康复了，多亏抚子跟player这段时间常来看我。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_07@真的？那就太好了，咲就是要健健康康的才好呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_08@抚子摸了摸咲的头。\n咲原本很开心的样子，但像是想起了什么，轻轻皱眉。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_09@抚子，我有点在意一件事……可以问妳吗？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_11@就是……只要有player在场，我都会觉得自己的力气好像变小了，这是正常的吗？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_12@嗯……说不定是正常的呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_13@以人体构造来说，男生的肌肉通常比女生发达；\n更何况player还是运动竞赛的教练啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_14@所以在player身边，咲的力气也不会显得太突出了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_15@对喔！抚子好聪明。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_16@呵呵。虽然已经康复了，还是要多多休息喔。\n我晚一点再到花店去找妳。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_17@欢迎！那我就先回去等妳来啰。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_18@道别后，咲走出抚子的办公室，轻轻阖上门。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_19@虽然抚子这么说……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_20@（但，只要靠近player，我就会浑身发热、使不上力气……）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_1_21@（这个……也是因为体格差距造成的吗？）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_01@某个气候宜人的下午，歌声顺着街道一路溜近。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_02@就是这里吗？Zumi一直说想来看看的花店。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_03@呵呵，刚好今天没事，先来探路，\n下次再带她过来、给她一个惊喜～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_05@怎、怎么了！？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_06@小纯探头进去。\n只见一名少女坐在地上，身边是散落一地的杂物。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_07@妳没事吧？我扶妳起来。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_08@是不小心跌倒了吗？哇，这个花瓶都摔碎了……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_09@哈哈……我刚刚碰倒花瓶，本来想冲过去接的，但又怕自己控制不住力气；结果犹豫之下，反而撞倒更多东西……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_10@我有点笨手笨脚的，让妳看笑话了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_11@啊，妳就是Zumi说的、力气很大又很可爱的咲吗？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_12@咦？妳认识Zumi？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_13@我是Zumi的姐姐：小纯，\n前几天有事到隔壁的城市，今天才刚回来。请多指教喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_14@请多指教！谢谢妳扶我起来，小纯是很温柔的人呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_15@咲也是啊，这间花店看起来很温馨，一定花了妳不少时间经营吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_16@这是奶奶留下来的。但我不太擅长整理，总觉得有点糟蹋了……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_17@不会啦，Zumi跟我说，妳只有一个人在打理这家店吧？\n那当然会忙不过来。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_18@我陪妳一起做吧。这个要放那里吗？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_19@咦、咦咦？这样不太好──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_20@没关系、没关系～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_21@半小时后
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_22@总觉得，店里好像变宽敞了，走路也不太容易撞到东西……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_23@小纯太厉害了！谢谢妳的帮忙，坐下来喝点饮料吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_24@嗯……这个味道……\n好香喔，是熏衣草吗？好像还有一点柠檬草……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_25@原来妳也了解植物吗？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_26@一点点～我很喜欢花草茶唷。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_27@哈哈，那以后欢迎妳常过来，我可以跟妳分享很多秘方～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_28@好呀好呀！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P027_N_2_29@午后的风吹过，带着清雅的香气，还有女孩们娇脆的笑声……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_01@Today is the release date of the latest gaming console, and I was ready with credit card in hand.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_02@As I was about to head out, I just happened to bump into Itsuki who looked like she was heading out too. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_03@Hey, Itsuki, you going out too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_04@... Master! That's right I have some errands to run. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_05@Is that so? If we're heading in the same direction, do you mind if I tag along?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_06@I turn around to lock the dormitory door. For some reason, Itsuki blushes a bright red and starts stammering. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_07@I-I'm going to... never mind! I'm in no rush. I'll accompany master first!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_08@Half-jokingly, I look at Itsuki suspiciously and she squirms under my gaze. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_09@I think I know where Itsuki is going. I overheard Akane mentioning the next episode of a girl's comic is out. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_10@Alright, I'm just messing with you. Let's get going! I still need to get my hands on that gaming console. It feels like my chances are much higher with you around. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_11@I remember that Itsuki is an exceptional ninja. It's finally time to put her to good use. Getting her hands on a gaming console should be a walk in the park!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_12@You can count on me. I will definitely get master what he wants...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_13@Itsuki, do you even know what a gaming console is...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_14@We walk and chat as we turn down the street.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_15@Such good weather today, the sun is out in full force. As we were just about to turn a corner, I see a figure rush towards me.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_16@Master, watch out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_17@I am suddenly pushed to one side. The force of Itsuki's shove almost dislocates my shoulder. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_18@Ouch! Itsuki, what are you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_19@Itsuki continues to keep her guard up while also helping me to my feet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_20@It is then that I see a sharp kunai stuck just inches from where I am standing. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_21@Master, are you OK? I'm so sorry. I pushed you out of reflex...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_22@I'm fine, at least I'm still alive. Just what is going on though?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_23@I try to wrap my head around the situation with my gaming console-filled mind. Itsuki on the other hand, picks up the kunai and inspects it carefully. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_24@Itsuki, is this related to you in any way?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_25@I-I'm not sure... but I'll get to the bottom of this. Anyways, let's go get that gaming console of yours first! I gave you my word and I'm going to keep it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_26@... Thank you, Itsuki. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_27@I almost forgot that Itsuki is the type of person that must see something to its end once she gives her word. I still haven't completely gotten over what just happened, but if Itsuki thinks it's fine then I guess I'll just leave it at that.   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_28@Is it my imagination or is Itsuki more on edge than usual?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_29@In the middle of the night, I had just finished taking a shower and was heading back to my room as I passed through the dark and empty team lobby.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_30@From the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow move towards the exit and open the door. Thanks to the light from outside I was able to make out that it was Itsuki. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_31@Itsuki! Where are you going so late?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_32@I call out to get Itsuki's attention. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_33@I have to go confirm something, Master. I'll be fine. You should go back to your room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_34@Hey, wait. Itsuki! Let me tag along...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_35@Before I can finish my sentence, Itsuki nimbly somersaults onto the roof. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_36@She said that she had to confirm something... what could it be? I can't help but think back about the incident that happened today. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_37@What is going on right now... Could it be a rival team trying to assassinate me? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_38@This ludicrous thought popped into my mind and was almost immediately dismissed. I chase after Itsuki... but like a normal person on the ground. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_39@I had to take the long way around my neighbors garden, but I finally managed to catch a glimpse of Itsuki up on the roofs. At the same time, I also see her in a standoff with a... ninja? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_40@Oboro, how long have you been around? Why did you attack us...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_41@Itsuki... senpai. You still remember my name. I thought that you had already forgotten the names given to us as ninjas!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_42@The ninja called Oboro glared at Itsuki angrily while pointing at her. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_43@Oboro, I don't know what you're talking about. Attacking innocent bystanders is against the rules, even more so when it's the master!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_44@Senpai, just look how low you have fallen. Have you forgotten the ninja's creed?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_45@What makes you think that, Oboro? I have found my calling here as a ninja. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_46@If you were still the ninja that you used to be, then how come you didn't notice me trailing you during the day! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_47@This proves that this city has tainted you, made you grow lax, and made you forget the path of the ninja!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_48@... Oboro, let's calm down first. Listen to me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_49@Senpai... Itsuki! It's too late for words! I only believe my own two eyes. Let me cut away at all the barriers that obstruct your way! Ninjutsu: Shadown Clone technique! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_50@I hear Oboro yell out as I peek from my secret hiding spot behind a telephone pole, and suddenly she appears right in front of my face with a cold glint in her eyes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_51@Master!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_1_52@Itsuki calls out as I subconsciously try to move away. Am I going to die before I even have a chance to get my hands on the new gaming console...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_01@In the blink of an eye, Itsuki throws several kunai at Oboro's shadow clones. In order to dodge the incoming projectiles, Oboro stops and shifts to the side. This gives me a little breathing room. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_02@Itsuki jumps down in front of me and deflects several of Oboro's sword swings.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_03@The intensity of the blows sounds like they're playing some kind of rhythm game. The reality that I almost just died still hasn't struck me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_04@Let's stop, Oboro! This isn't neccessary!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_05@Itsuki, it seems that you still remember how to swing a blade. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_06@Even if Itsuki had blocked all of her attacks, there is no sign of displeasure on her face. On the contrary, Oboro can't help but smile. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_07@I've told you before, a day hasn't gone by where I have forgotten about my training and mission.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_08@Itsuki looks at me with a gentle but firm expression. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_09@Oboro doesn't catch the hidden meaning behind Itsuki's gaze. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_10@Even so, you are someone I look up to and it is my duty to remind you of everything that you may have forgotten! Itsuki, I will help you recall your battle instincts!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_11@Oboro throws a smoke bomb and disappears before our eyes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_12@As I got up from the ground and saw Itsuki with a troubled look on her face, a twinge of regret shot through my heart.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_13@I'm sorry, Itsuki... It seems like I have caused a misunderstanding between you two.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_14@N-No, it isn't master's fault. This is something between Oboro and I.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_15@Is she also... part of your tribe?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_16@Yes, Oboro is younger than me. She takes things very seriously and had always thrown herself full-heartedly into practicing ninjutsu. Sometimes she would even forget to eat. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_17@Itsuki's face when reminiscing about the past is almost angelic under the light of the moon. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_18@Oboro is regarded as a prodigy, but she looks up to me... and works hard to follow in my footsteps. I believe that it won't take long before she surpasses me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_19@Itsuki can't help but relax the frown on her face when talking about Oboro. This is the first time that I have seen her with such a proud expression as she thought back about the past. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_20@You two share such a special bond. It must be her first time coming to a big city. Why don't we invite her over for tea at our team quarters? You two can even go out and catch up. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_21@I... was thinking the same thing. The problem is, I'll need to convice her first, or else the same situation will just replay itself. I don't want master to be harmed in any way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_22@That's right, I almost died today... It still hasn't sunk in, but we better solve this problem first. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_23@Now I have two things on my mind—I still haven't gotten my hands on the latest gaming console, and that this situation with Oboro will somehow affect Itsuki. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_24@Master, don't worry. I will protect you with my life. I'll find a way to convince her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_25@Thanks, Itsuki. Don't push yourself too hard. Feel free to come to me with any ideas, I'm your master after all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_26@I gently patted Itsuki's head and she nods shyly. Her expression was one of determination. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_27@After seeing an actual ninja battle happen before my eyes, I suddenly had an irresistable urge to order a ninja game online...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_28@Over the next few days, Oboro was true to her words and made it her calling to help Itsuki return to her past self. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_29@Oboro! Wait, listen to me—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_30@Itsuki, if you want me to listen to you, you'll have to prove yourself with all you've got! Or else I won't give up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_31@After countless sneak attacks, Itsuki still had no luck in getting Oboro to listen to her explanation. It was like talking to a wall. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_32@Oh no, I'm so sorry! I'll get you a new bowl!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_33@After each fight between the girls, I'm the one that takes care of the mess...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_34@This time, Oboro assaulted Itsuki and I as we were having lunch in a restaurant. Itsuki deflected the kunai, but it ricocheted off a wall and into the bowl of a table next to us. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_35@I'm sorry for the trouble, sir...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_36@After seeing the cute Itsuki apologize, the angery customer was placated and returned to his seat. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_37@We can't keep this up forever, Itsuki. We need to come up with a plan...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_38@Just the reimbursement fees alone is enough to bankrupt me! I don't even need to think about purchasing my games at this rate. Also, I would like to live a few more years!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_39@Oboro is stubborn, but I think I know how to get to her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_40@Let's come up with a plan for Oboro; not to defeat her, but to capture her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_41@I may have proposed this strategy, but I still need to rely on Itsuki's understanding of Oboro. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_42@Itsuki looks at me with a confident smile. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_2_43@I have just the idea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_01@Today is the day that Itsuki and I planned on catching Oboro. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_02@We even chose a weekday picnic at a park so that collateral damage would be kept to a minimum. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_03@Itsuki, is this... really going to work?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_04@I look at the disguise I'm wearing. It is an ancient ninja art passed down through generations. Not only do I look exactly like Itsuki, I also sound exactly like her. 　 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_05@Our plan to capture Oboro is for me to impersonate Itsuki and let down my guard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_06@Don't worry, master... you won't get hurt, not even a scratch!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_07@Whenever the issue is about me, Itsuki takes things even more seriously. That's why I should give Itsuki the benefit of the doubt during our capture operations.   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_08@Itsuki is the one that knows Oboro the best, but I still can't help but feel uneasy being so passive and defenseless. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_09@I might as well have a bite while waiting... Ahh! What!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_10@You're full of openings, Itsuki!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_11@Just as I was about to pick up a sandwich, a figure suddenly rushes towards me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_12@Without time to react, I am slammed heavily into the ground and the pressure on my chest is suffocating. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_13@My eyes focus and I see that it is our target—Oboro. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_14@Itsuki, I'm disappointed. Have you forgotten the ninja survival breathing technique that was ingrained into our minds ever since we were little? Let me give you a crash course today!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_15@Oboro doesn't hold back as she chokes me with her hands. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_16@How is this teaching me...?! I can't help but marvel at the intensity of ninja training. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_17@You've let down your guard, Oboro!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_18@The real Itsuki strikes the unsuspecting Oboro with her hand and paralyzes her. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_19@C-Cough, cough... I was at death's door again...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_20@Oboro can't believe her eyes as Itsuki deftly ties her up with a piece of rope. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_21@Master, are you OK?! Are you hurt anywhere?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_22@I'm fine. Cough cough. You've tied up Oboro...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_23@I massage my chest and neck as I catch my breath. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_24@That's right, she will be unable to speak for a while. Oboro, could you listen to what I have to say?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_25@Oboro all tied up and sitting on the ground, glares at me. I can tell she is full of hostility aimed towards me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_26@I know that you think it's master and this city's fault that I've become like this, right? The thing is... that's not entirely true. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_27@It is master who has shown me my true calling and potential. It is this city that has expanded my horizons. That's why I am thankful for all that master has done, and I have fallen in love with this city.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_28@I suddenly feel as if Itsuki has matured a lot after listening to her speak from the heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_29@That's why I need you to accept this fact, Oboro! I'm not the person that I used to be before, but I have never, not even a single day, forgotten who I was. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_30@You may have high expectations for me, but I have already found my true calling. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_31@Itsuki... I never knew about all this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_32@Without anyone noticing, Oboro was already able to talk and to our surprise she wasn't mad at all. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_33@Oboro was crestfallen and looked like she had a thousand things to say. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_34@Now you know, Oboro. I'm happy here. If you're willing to accept that, then come check out the team. I can show you around. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_35@... I will go wherever Itsuki goes. That is something that I have decided from the start!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_36@Thank you, Oboro, but there are still some things that I have to teach you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_37@There is a content smile on Itsuki's face as she unties Oboro. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_38@First rule of living in the city—Don't be a bother to other people. Oboro, I want you to always keep this in mind!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_39@A-Alright! I'll be sure to remember that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_40@Good. As for the second rule—master's safety is always of the utmost priority...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_41@I eat my sandwich as I watch Itsuki teaching Oboro the ropes as she sits upright and fully at attention.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_42@At least everything turned out alright...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_43@For the next few days, I would take Oboro around the city during free time in-between team training. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_44@Oboro also followed the rules set by Itsuki regarding survival in the city. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_45@Oboro, you haven't seen the rest of the team right? Do you want to come to a party? It'll be fun, there will be delicious cake to eat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_46@In order to reward Oboro for her hardwork, the girls and I decided to throw her a welcoming party. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_47@A party... what's that like?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_48@I remember that Oboro's childhood must have consisted completely of rigorous training, so she wouldn't know what a party is.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_49@I'll keep that a secret for now. Just come later and you'll find out. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_50@I brought the curious and eager Oboro back to the dormitory. Everything should be ready by now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_51@As soon as we enter the door, Itsuki brings Oboro to the middle of the room. All the other girls flock around her and start chatting non-stop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_52@Here, try some of the cake. It's a new flavor!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_53@Itsuki slices a large piece of cake for Oboro who doesn't know where to put her hands. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_54@Just relax, Oboro, everything will be alright. All the girls here are very nice. They've taken great care of me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_55@Itsuki gently pats Oboro's head as she accepts the cake and quietly thanks Itsuki. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_56@I let out a sigh of relief as I was scared that Oboro would refuse. It seemed that inviting her over was the right call. If I could leave a good impression in Oboro's mind it would be the perfect result.   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_3_57@Just as everything was going smoothly, Oboro suddenly disappeared from the party. I knew that something must be done when I saw Itsuki's worried expression. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_01@I had the other people wait inside while I went out to find Oboro. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_02@Seeing how I was the one that invited her over, I should be responsible for getting her back. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_03@Yet, without Itsuki's help I don't even know where to start looking. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_04@Oboro likes to hide in high places, especially on top of trees... I think she feels safe there. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_05@High places, trees... These clues aren't that specific, but I know the surrounding area like the back of my hand. There is a place that fits both descriptions. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_06@I quickly find Oboro just where I expected her to be. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_07@Oboro, do you want to have some more cake? Or do you want cookies? Akane is also makes the most delicious cookies. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_08@I ended up at a park near the team dormitory. Next to the park there is a tall ancient tree that has been here long before we moved here. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_09@Maybe you want something salty instead? We have pasta in the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_10@Good thing there wasn't a lot of people in the park, or I would have been slightly embarassed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_11@Oboro hides quitely on top of the tree. Her expression was as forlorn as that day when Itsuki told her everything. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_12@I don't want to go. You can leave. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_13@Itsuki will be worried about you. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_14@I sized up the height of the tree and attempted to climb up. It wasn't as easy as I thought... There weren't many purchase points near the bottom of the trunk.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_15@If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer them. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_16@I look at Oboro who seemed to be biting her tongue. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_17@... I'm sorry. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_18@The sudden apology caught me off-guard. I don't know the reason that Oboro is apologizing. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_19@Why the sudden apology? You didn't do anything wrong, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_20@Ever since Itsuki told me everything, I couldn't get it out of my mind... When I first arrived, I thought that everyone was hedonistic. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_21@Oboro shook her head as if denying what she just said. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_22@I know now that I was too full of myself and was imposing my own views on others. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_23@I never took the time to understand that everyone in this city is also working so hard to survive. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_24@After seeing the smiles of the girls on the team, I finally knew just how arrogant I was. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_25@The lonely expression on Oboro's face was evident. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_26@Don't kick yourself too hard. You know now, and that's all that matters. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_27@It's hard to get rid of prejudices. Congratulations! Itsuki would be glad!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_28@I don't know if that comforted her, but Oboro looked at me for a while before finally giving me a tiny smile. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_29@I knew that everything would be alright. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_30@Oh, by the way, Oboro. What do you say about staying and practicing with the team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_31@Our practice is no laughing matter. I believe that this would also be good training for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_32@... OK, I'm willing to give it a try. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_33@That's wonderful! Why don't you come down and we'll go get some cake together. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_34@Oboro smiles at me. Just as Oboro was about to jump down from the tree with the prowress of a ninja, a stranger passed by and noticed our odd behaviour...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_35@Suddenly remembering Itsuki's rules for survival in the city (First rule—Don't be a bother to other people.), Oboro became flustered and lost her balance as she fell out of the tree. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_36@One day you'll be the death of me... Are you OK?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_37@I help Oboro off of my chest once again. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_38@I'm sorry...! I'm perfectly fine. I'll get up right away!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_39@Oboro blushes as she fumbles to get up. I can't help but want to tease her as I see her bright red cheeks and feel her soft warm body against mine. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_40@I grab Oboro and she is forced to lie on top of me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_4_41@That being said... How are you going to make up for that time when you pinned me to the ground and almost killed me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_01@朧也留在戰隊一個月了，她的表現很好，態度也像伊月說的那樣，非常認真。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_02@就算朧相當投入戰隊的練習，她也不忘時常找伊月切磋忍術。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_03@終於，這天在戰隊的訓練場地，朧贏得了可貴的一次勝利……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_04@看看我的新招式吧前輩！影分身之術！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_05@原本只是單純的用來混淆敵方視線的多重分身，卻不知道朧怎麼做到的，每個分身居然都像是有了自己的意識，展開了對伊月的隨機攻擊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_06@雖然只是很簡單的攻擊，但是伊月並未料想到這個發展，所以頗有些狼狽地退敗了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_07@朧，又進步了，我被打敗了呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_08@伊月微笑著擦了擦汗，欣慰地輕輕拍著朧的肩膀贊許著。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_09@……我只是這次比較幸運而已，下次前輩就贏回來了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_10@不，這是你努力的證明，你打敗我了。我的體術的確也還欠缺鍛煉。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_11@下一次也請朧多多指教喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_12@朧聽著伊月的話，臉又紅了起來。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_13@對了，朧，這是給你的獎勵喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_14@伊月從一旁的袋子裡拿出一瓶液體。瓶身大大地寫著「清爽果汁」的字樣。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_15@前輩，這是什麼？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_16@朧好奇地接過了瓶子，端詳著充滿彩色圖案、商標與營養標示的瓶身。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_17@這是……屬於城市的、可以「恢復精神的秘藥」喔，朧也可以喝喝看，我想你會喜歡的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_18@伊月露出有點調皮又故做神秘的笑容。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_19@謝謝前輩，我會好好品嘗的！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_20@朧開心而珍視地抱著那瓶「秘藥」，目送著伊月離去。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_21@伊月前輩…不管以後會變得怎麼樣，你都會是我唯一追尋的目標。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_22@朧看著手上的瓶子喃喃自語，接著又好奇地扭開瓶蓋嗅了嗅。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_23@聞起來甜甜的…既然是前輩給的，一定是好東西！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_24@朧眼睛也不眨地喝了一大口，然而舌尖感受到的是黏膩的汁液，像糖漿果凍一樣包覆著舌頭。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_1_25@……這到底、是什麼，好噁心…一點都不清爽。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_01@在天氣良好的某日，海岸邊卷著漂亮的細碎白色浪花。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_02@一名少女正在礁石堆中敏捷地移動，似乎正在進行什麼訓練。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_03@呼～透過在淩亂的岩石堆裡迅速移動，一定能提升我的機動性和對環境的敏銳度。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_04@朧用手背擦拭額邊汗水，一邊滿意地肯定自己的訓練。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_05@就在朧稍做休息，正要繼續練習時，一道頗有朝氣的聲音傳了過來。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_06@喂，你！你在這裡做什麼？這裡可是私有地吶！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_07@……私有地，是什麼意思？你又是誰？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_08@朧停下了動作，望著聲音來源看過去。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_09@那是一位看起來和自己年紀相仿的少女，正手插著腰，一隻腳還大剌剌地踩在礁岩上。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_10@哈啊？是我先問妳問題的喔！難道說，你是「同行」嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_11@少女狐疑地問著。雖然朧完全聽不懂，但是朧仍然回答著。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_12@「同行」又是什麼意思？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_13@這下少女有點愣住了，這該怎麼解釋？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_14@如果沒事的話，我要繼續進行訓練了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_15@朧見少女愣在原地，就不再管她，打算繼續鍛煉。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_16@訓練？你在說什麼訓練？你是來海邊運動嗎？你是運動選手嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_17@少女覺得今天大概是她此生直至目前為止，拋出過最多問句的一次吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_18@運動選手又是什麼？我只是來這裡進行我的體術練習。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_19@朧露出的困惑神色，總算讓少女恍然大悟——原來是遇到了一個無關寶藏、只想鍛煉的孩子。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_20@雖然不懂你說的體術是什麼，不過我大概知道你不是「同行」了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_21@少女大聲笑了出來。那大笑的模樣讓朧有點不知所措。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_22@我叫安潔兒，你呢？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_23@少女——安潔兒大聲詢問著朧的名字。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_24@既然你都報上名字了，那我也該回敬。我叫朧，是一名忍者！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_25@哦～忍者啊，我還是第一次看到呢！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_26@安潔兒打量著朧，看著朧認真的神情，突然興起了玩心。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_27@別練習了，要不要和我一起去尋寶呀？很有趣喔！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_28@我可以順路帶妳去這附近的秘密景點，還可以帶你去抓螃蟹！你抓過螃蟹嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_29@可是我…我今天是來訓練的……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_30@朧確實有些動搖，她覺得這片海已經很美了，她還想知道哪裡有更美的景色。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_31@而且她沒抓過螃蟹呢……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_32@訓練不管什麼時候都可以，但是好天氣和好風景可不是每天有喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_33@你不來的話，我可是要自己去抓螃蟹了！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_34@……我不去。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_35@朧幾經思考，最後還是紅著臉拒絕了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_36@安潔兒想了想，決定拋出殺手鐧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_37@這樣吧，一個人行動還是挺危險的，我請你當我的保鑣，給你這個當作酬勞怎麼樣？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_38@安潔兒掏出了一小袋東西，她打開袋子給朧看。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_39@裡面是一整袋的圓形的巧克力，巧克力散發香甜的氣味，不斷誘惑著朧的嗅覺。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_40@這是什麼…？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_41@這是巧克力，很貴呦！我好不容易搶到的！怎麼樣，要考慮一下我的提議嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_42@…好吧！我去！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P028_N_2_43@安潔兒開心地把巧克力塞到朧的懷裡，拉著朧出發去…尋寶？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_01@It's been a long time since the last time I saw it. I'm soooooo excited!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_02@Yui, you're spasming in excitement... Is that okay for an idol?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_03@I'm not working right now~ Even an idol needs some time to rest!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_04@Yui invited me to a bar to see her favorite band's live tonight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_05@I do want some drinks to ease the tiredness accumulated for this week, so I decided to go with her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_06@Is this band that famous?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_07@It's like super duper famous~ They started with only two members but now they have four.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_08@As this band grows more and more popular, most of their lives leave no vacancy. It's very hard to even get a ticket~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_09@Is that so? But the venue today doesn't seem so crowded as I imagined.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_10@It's because their live today is a pop-up performance! (Whisper) It's not officially announced, but I got the secret information about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_11@What secret information... Alright, stop being so hyped. How much have you drunk already?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_12@I didn't drink at all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_13@Just when I make fun of Yui, the light on the stage gradually fades.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_14@The members of the band go up to the stage, doing the final check on their instruments.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_15@Thank you so much for coming. We're starting now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_16@Yui, who's the girl speaking? The lead singer?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_17@The girl holding a mic and talking looks extremely indifferent, with no smile on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_18@She's Tsugumi, the lead singer~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_19@Now that you're here, Coach should immerse yourself in the attractiveness of live performances!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_20@Honestly speaking, I, I'd rather go drinking aside...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_21@If I don't like their performance, Yui, you'll have to give me a massage as compensation after going back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_22@Huh~ Why~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_23@After the band's performance begins, maybe for the agitative music they're playing, the audience crowds forwards and started to shout along with the song.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_24@The lead singer Tsugumi's voice that sounds slightly like a screaming vocal invaded my ears throughout my brain like a faint electric current.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_25@Normally I don't like this kind of occasion, but I just can't help grooving my body along with the music.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_26@Tsugumi! Tsugumi! Here! Notice me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_27@Besides Yui's nonstop yells, I'm also surrounded by the delightful shouts from other people.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_28@Tsugumi looks sometimes wild, and sometimes enchanting on the stage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_29@Sometimes glancing at the crowd, and sometimes blooming a smile, she has various ways to interact with her audience.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_30@Now I seem to understand why Yui likes her so much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_31@Woah~~ This live was just amazing as usual! Coach, how do you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_32@Hmm, well... Not too shabby. The lead singer does have a great voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_33@Every time I hear Tsugumi sings, I just can't help singing along. And my body feels hotter and hotter!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_34@Isn't it because it's crowded here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_35@Coach, live concerts are something you enjoy with both your mind and body~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_36@What? Fine, I'll try it... It must be because I drank too little tonight...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_37@The band members go down the stage to interact with their fans after the performance. But I don't see Tsugumi, the lead singer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_38@When I'm talking with Yui, a band member comes to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_39@Yui, thank you so much for coming!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_40@It's my pleasure~ Thank you for the secret information about your pop-up performance as always~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_41@So you got your "secret info" from a member of the band...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_42@That's right! She's a friend I met at an idol event before!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_43@But is it okay for the lead singer to leave so soon? Doesn't she have to come and take pictures with her fans or something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_44@Oh... Tsugumi always leaves right after a performance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_45@So despite her perfect performance in lives, some fans of the band consider her big-headed and indifferent...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_46@Hehe, Tsugumi is actually a gentle and friendly person!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_47@But she can be pretty timid sometimes, so she doesn't actively interact with strangers a lot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_48@Oh, so that's what she's like...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_49@Yui, don't you know Tsugumi? I thought you're friends as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_50@I do know her~ But we're not close enough for me to know her personality. All I know is her style on the stage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_51@Sometimes Tsugumi gets dissed by some fans because of her attitude. But that's all a misunderstanding.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_52@We can actually see Tsugumi's effort.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_54@I guess no matter how talented one is, people would still take them as how they look.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_55@I have to admit that I didn't take this concert seriously at all. Neither did I believe the captivation of live concerts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_1_56@But Tsugumi made this live pretty impressive to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_01@The band is holding a performance again in a bar tonight, so Yui takes me there to watch it together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_02@Tsugumi's vocal again matches the music played by other members perfectly. In addition, both her eyes and voice still make me tremble in excitement this time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_03@Coach! Wasn't the live today also wonderful~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_04@Yes, yes~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_05@Hold on~ Coach! Since we're here, why don't we take a picture together with the members?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_06@Give me a second. I want to use the toilet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_07@I answer in a helpless tone, for I really want to pee!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_08@Hm? Isn't that girl the lead singer?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_09@Just when I pass by the ladies restroom, I see Tsugumi and another girl from the corner of my eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_10@What kind of attitude is that?! I only asked for a selfie together. Do you have to give me that cold stare?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_11@I didn't mean it at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_12@What did you mean then?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_13@Tsugumi's faint voice is almost sunk into the fury of the stranger.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_14@Khok, khok, ahem...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_15@After noticing me approaching, the stranger leaves sulkily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_16@Um... Are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_17@I'm all good. Thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_18@Looking upset, Tsugumi takes over the tissue I give her and thanks me in a whisper with tears brimming in her eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_19@With the conversation with Yui and another band member last time coming to my mind, I suddenly understand the incident that just happened.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_20@I know it's a little bit abrupt to say it right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_21@But thanks to Yui, I get to know you and your band. Your performances are really great!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_22@... Oh, Yui brought you here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_23@Yes. She likes you a lot and often recommends you to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_24@Ah, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm her coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_25@Coach... I did hear that Yui joined a water gun team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_26@Right. That's my team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_27@Well, hi... I'm Tsugumi.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_28@Since I knew Tsugumi already, I just nod after hearing her short self-introduction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_29@There's a girl called Yandere Chan on my team. She used to be misunderstood because she wasn't so good at getting along with people as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_30@But people misunderstand you simply because they don't know you yet, so I think you can be more confident about yourself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_31@You...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_32@Tsugumi seems pretty surprised at what I said, for she just listens silently without any response.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_33@Well, I'm not sure what just happened here, so I made some assumptions.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_34@Of course, those were my personal opinions. I didn't mean to teach you any lesson or something, so I hope you're not offended.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_35@When I start to regret being too talkative, Tsugumi looks like she wants to say something but is still hesitating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_36@Actually, I'm already used to being misunderstood, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_37@I don't want my band to be affected by those misunderstandings towards my personal actions in private.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_38@Since all of us devote ourselves so much to this band...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_39@Even though Tsugumi says she has been used to it, I guess she still feels pretty depressed to be misunderstood like that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_40@I got it. Instead of worrying about yourself being misunderstood, you're worrying about other members more. Tsugumi is a really sweet and considerate person!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_41@I... I just want things to go better!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_42@And... now that our band is getting more and more popular, I don't want to hold our band back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_43@You and the other members have been working together for so long, I'm sure they can understand what you're struggling with.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_44@But I still want to improve this... I want to try what I can do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_45@At least, at least I don't want to bother anyone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_46@Hearing Tsugumi's determination, I start to think about the possible methods to improve the situation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_47@Hmm... How about let's start from... controlling your facial expression? People with a smile on their face always give others a better impression, don't you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_48@Wearing a smile on my face...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_49@That's right! Try giving a smile to fans when you see them, since they're the ones who truly like you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_50@Tsugumi ponders and nods, as if thinking about something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_51@I think you can practice with a mirror at first, so don't be so nervous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_52@You can start worrying about other things after you can relax your nervous face. What do you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_53@... Sure. Thanks for the advice. I'll try to do it at a mirror first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_54@To avoid giving Tsugumi too much pressure, I say in a funny tone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_55@I'm happy to practice with you if you want, since I can now be said one of your fans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_56@And it's easier to simulate a scenario with a bystander.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_57@Okay. I guess I do need a scenario.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_58@How about let's pick up a day then? I know a cafe suitable for the practice near our dorm!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_59@Then I'm available these days...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_2_60@I think Tsugumi really cares about her band a lot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_01@After that, Tsugumi comes to me to practice controlling her facial expression a lot. At first, she could only squeeze a strange smile out of her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_02@Then I would start telling some jokes that even I considered nonsense.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_03@Hey.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_04@Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_05@It was two-tired!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_06@Hehe——
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_07@These kinds of bad jokes always make Tsugumi burst into laughter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_08@Looking at the laughing Tsugumi, while feeling confused about her sense of humor, I feel happy for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_09@So it is about the mood?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_10@Now I can feel myself... smiling in a more relaxed mood.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_11@Yes. Once you become more relaxed, you can express your emotions in a more natural way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_12@But Tsugumi, you do have a weird sense of humor...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_13@It's... it's only because I laugh easily...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_14@And because your jokes are always weird!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_15@Both of us burst into laughter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_16@The Tsugumi off stage is a girl who shows effort to improve herself for others' sake. That's a different kind of charm than the one she shows on the stage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_17@This night, I come to a bar to appreciate the band's live again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_18@But this time, Tsugumi took the initiative to invite me here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_19@Th-Thank you... Yes. Let's take a picture together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_20@Surrounded by the crowd, Tsugumi looks much less uncomfortable than she used to be.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_21@This is the fruit of Tsugumi's numerous practices. I really feel so happy for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_22@Though she still looks pretty nervous, Tsugumi's practice these days is working.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_23@In the green room, I take out the little present I prepared for Tsugumi.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_24@Yes. This is a gift. Just take it as a reward to celebrate you conquering your inner fear!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_25@What's inside the box...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_26@Tsugumi takes over the gift box bashfully and looks surprised after opening it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_27@It's a pair of earrings.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_28@I asked the other band members for the color and style you prefer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_29@This... I can't take this. I didn't do anything for you. Instead, I was taken care of by you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_30@Don't say something like that. I'm glad to be your partner for the practice!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_31@And you invited me to your live today, didn't you? Just take it as a gift in return!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_32@... Thank you. I'll cherish it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_33@Looking at the pair of earrings, Tsugumi blooms a faint smile. Along with the rosy cheeks, her smile looks more natural and adorable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_34@Who can ever dislike her after seeing this kind of smile?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_35@As if treating a precious treasure, Tsugumi gently put the pair of earrings into the box. I immediately stop her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_36@Hold on! Let me put it on for you. It's a perfect time to see if it suits you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_37@There's no mirror in the green room, so I take the earrings from Tsugumi and lean closer to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_38@O-Okay... Please do me the favor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_39@After tucking her hair behind her ears, I wear the earrings onto Tsugumi's ears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_40@The design of the earrings matches perfectly with Tsugumi's petite ears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_41@They do suit Tsugumi. You look gorgeous with these!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_42@Tsugumi raises her hand to touch the earrings on her ears, and again blooms a shallow, shy smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_43@Thank you for everything you've done.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_44@It's so quiet in the green room that I can hear people talking outside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_45@To wear the earrings for Tsugumi, I am so close to her that we can hear our breaths clearly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_46@I don't want other people to see Tsugumi's innocent and pure look like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_3_47@I start to feel complicated about the result of our practice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_01@Today is Tsugumi's band's live with a signing session.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_02@To show my support, I bought a ticket and come to the event.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_03@It's still so crowded...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_04@The venue that is not very wide is crowded with people looking excited about the event.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_05@CDs and merch are also sold next to the stage. I go up and buy an album.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_06@Thank you so much for coming. If you like our songs, please go check the merch sold next to the stage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_07@After the live today, there will be a signing session. So feel free to stat for that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_08@After Tsugimi's speech with a smile, the audience gives her cheerful applause.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_09@I've heard so many times of the band's concert already.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_10@So I'm also familiar with Tsugumi's vocal, which is still so touching and full of emotion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_11@So... How can I get to the backstage in such a crowded venue...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_12@I'm thinking about giving Tsugumi a surprise in the backstage, yet the hallway to it is so crowded that I can't even move an inch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_13@Without any alternative, I can only stay there for a couple of minutes to wait for everyone to head over where the band members are.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_14@Please stay in line! The signing session will start in ten minutes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_15@The staff shouts with a speaker.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_16@While those people are buzzing around, I secretly sneak to the stairs and walk up to the empty hallway towards the backstage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_17@Phew~ It was such a brilliant decision to hide myself first. It's really crowded and hot outside...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_18@Just when I'm basking in my wisdom, I hear someone walking towards me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_19@Yes. Then please do that. I'll get changed and go out soon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_20@It's Tsugumi. She's probably talking to staff.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_21@So I shrink my body to the corner, planning to surprise Tsugumi when she walks by.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_22@Eh? player, why are you here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_23@... Hi, Tsugumi. I was planning to surprise you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_24@She must have seen the bag of albums and merch I didn't hide well enough.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_25@Fans can't come to the backstage. You'll be in trouble should you be seen. Come here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_26@Ah, oh, alright.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_27@Tsugumi grabs my hand and runs into her green room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_28@While I look around the room, Tsugumi locked the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_29@I didn't expect the green room to be so wide.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_30@It is. And the glass wall here can see the live venue down there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_31@Wow, the view is really good. But won't you be seen by people down there?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_32@Don't worry. The light is spotted on the first floor. And this glass is covered with some kind of paper that makes it anti-perspective.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_33@It's designed like this for the performers to know the situation of the venue while protecting their privacy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_34@Tsugumi explained the purpose of that glass wall in a serious tone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_35@However, a slightly evil idea comes to my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_36@Since we can't be seen from the outside... Tsugumi, why don't you just get changed here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_37@Eh? But...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_38@There are only five minutes left~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_4_39@Well... then... player, could you... pull the zipper on my back for me...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_01@亞海邀請我帶著整個戰隊的女孩們去看表演。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_02@唯還是那麼開心，果然是很喜歡這個樂團呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_03@讓我為大家隆重介紹一下，這是我最愛的樂團——
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_04@唯對著戰隊的女孩們滔滔不絕，但是表演快開始了，我只好制止她。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_05@大家，表演要開始囉！唯，小聲點啊啊啊啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_06@謝謝大家今天來看表演，那就不多說了，表演要開始了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_07@亞海已經能在舞台上簡單地說著開場白，果然是努力後得到的好成果。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_08@表演結束後，由唯帶頭，大家興緻高昂地圍著樂團成員聊天說話。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_09@只有亞海神色慌亂的樣子，往後台離去。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_10@奇怪……明明表演前還在的……難道是掉在前台嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_11@亞海，怎麼啦？一臉慌張的樣子。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_12@因為擔心亞海是出了什麼事，所以我也立即跟上了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_13@欸、是player…沒事！我很好！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_14@儘管亞海想裝出若無其事的樣子，但她眼神裡的慌張還是很明顯。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_15@……真的沒事嗎？我可以幫忙喔，不要覺得會麻煩到我。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_16@我、好吧，其實我剛才發現player你送的耳環不見了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_17@但是我一定會找到的！一定就在這附近……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_18@亞海流露出慌張無助的表情，似乎害怕我會因此而生氣。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_19@原來是這樣，我以為妳發生什麼事了，很擔心啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_20@耳環的話，我們一起找吧！兩個人找起來也比較快對吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_21@亞海看見我的反應，總算也安下心來了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_22@我們兩人從後臺走廊分頭慢慢搜尋，直到休息室內。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_23@還是沒看到呀……如果真的不見了怎麼辦……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_24@別緊張，休息室還沒找過呢！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_25@我打賭一定掉在這裡，要不要和我賭一杯飲料啊？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_26@眼看亞海似乎要開始緊張起來，我連忙以輕鬆的口吻安撫她。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_27@如果真的不見了，會對player很抱歉的，那是player的心意……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_28@就像你說的，那是我的心意，但是你有接收到才是最重要的喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_29@知道你這麼重視耳環，我就很高興了！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_30@休息室有些狹窄，我們尋找耳環時，總是會不小心觸碰到彼此的身體。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_31@亞海的身體柔軟且散發著熱氣，我覺得自己的手似乎總是想去追尋這道甜美的熱氣來源……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_32@欸，找到啦！原來掉在這裡。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_33@在休息室的單人沙發下，耳環閃著一點亮光。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_34@謝謝你！之後我會更小心的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_35@亞海再次戴上耳環。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_36@她看起來如此嬌小而纖細，皮膚的潤澤讓我想抬手去觸摸。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_37@好像我稍用一點力，她的肌膚就會流出甘美的汁液。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_1_38@那，player想喝什麼飲料？如果喜歡調酒類的話，我家、也可以哦……？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_01@午後時分，我正站在街角等待亞海的到來。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_02@前幾天我突然收到亞海的邀請，要一起去逛街。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_03@雖然不知道亞海想買什麼，不過正好我也趁這個機會添購一些衣物吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_04@對不起！等很久了嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_05@不會啦，我才剛來而已，倒是亞海不必用跑的啦。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_06@亞海因為在陽光下奔馳而留了一點汗，汗水在臉頰邊看起來閃閃發亮。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_07@player……喜歡什麼東西呢？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_08@比較喜歡實用性高的，還是裝飾性的？或是喜歡美食嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_09@欸，我嗎？仔細想我好像沒特別喜歡的東西啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_10@不過會特別採買的大概還是日常用得到的物品吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_11@日常物品嗎……範圍也太廣了，這樣要送什麼呢？（小聲）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_13@沒事！那我們先去看看那條街吧！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_14@總覺得今天的亞海特別主動的感覺，應該是好事吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_15@我們走的那條街主要是衣飾店。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_16@我和亞海也就隨意聊著天，一邊周旋在這些衣帽間。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_17@這件看起來…很適合player的風格，很簡潔的樣式，要試試看嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_18@不知為何亞海看著我的眼神裡，飽含著非常積極的期待……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_19@喔、好啊……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_20@我接過衣服進了更衣間。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_21@接下來一兩小時的流程都是這樣，亞海拿著一堆衣褲或鞋子要我換上試試。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_22@亞海拿著衣物在我身前比劃，她柔軟的身軀時不時與我的胸口相觸……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_23@雖然這是一件挺享受的事，但我還是困惑了起來。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_24@不知道這件player穿起來怎麼樣呢？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_25@等等啊，亞海，怎麼都是我在穿啊？你不試試看嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_26@我、我想先看看player穿起來怎麼樣……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_27@亞海今天真的有點奇怪…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_28@我為了搞清楚狀況，所以提議先去咖啡廳休息一下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_29@亞海，你難道有什麼事要跟我說嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_30@一坐下來，我就開門見山地問了，今天的亞海實在讓我太在意了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_31@欸、好吧，我只是想送player你禮物，畢竟受到你的很多照顧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_32@就算是我、也想表示一下心意的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_33@但是我不知道你喜歡什麼東西……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_34@原來是這樣，謝謝你。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_35@不過我幫忙亞海的本意也不是要什麼回報，所以放輕鬆就好啦！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_36@雖然我這麼回答了，亞海看起來卻有點難為情的樣子。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P029_N_2_37@唔、好的……那player下次還願意、陪我一起逛街嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_1@Nadeshiko and the chairman of the alliance speak on the phone while player is unaware.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_11@I want to listen to Nadeshiko carefully, but a powerful feeling surges up inside me, making me feel restless.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_12@For some reason, I stare fiercely at Nadeshiko’s breasts and remember the time when I fondled them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_13@(Nadeshiko has really big breasts...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_14@Coach... Are you feeling the mood too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_15@Nadeshiko looks at me gently. She looks so accommodating and tolerant that I feel like I’m doing something wrong.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_16@Oh! I’m sorry... I feel... strange.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_17@It’s all right... Let’s... Do it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_18@Nadeshiko really is gentle... But why does something feel wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_19@Nadeshiko climbs onto my bed and seats her warm and soft body on me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_20@Her plump breasts are pressed tightly against my hard cock. At the same time, she rubs them gently like she's guiding a young virgin who is doing it for the first time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_21@It’s fine, coach... Vent all your passion and desires onto me. It might be a little rough... But... It’s fine♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_22@Rough? Nadeshiko seems to be expecting me to act like this and I feel so strange right now. Did Nadeshiko do something to me...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_23@But my excited brain is incapable of thinking right now. All I manage to do is stare intently at Nadeshiko’s sexy body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_24@Nadeshiko unbuttons her shirt to reveal her giant melons in front of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_25@Like I’m bewitched, I can't resist the urge to suck on her nipples.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_26@Mmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_27@Nadeshiko caresses my head like a gently mother. Her moaning spurs me into sucking even more furiously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_29@You like my breasts? It’s all right... I’m happy to give you everything I have, coach...♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_30@The smell of her breasts is irresistible. Nadeshiko's body trembles with pleasure every time I suck on her nipples, and I feel like I can almost suck some milk out of them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_31@To be honest, I wouldn’t be surprised if I really do manage to suck some breast milk out of her. That’s because her breasts are just that slutty. And the proof of this is—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_33@Nadeshiko arches her back like she is spasming with electric currents running through her body. Her erect nipples are swollen and wet, which is especially attractive to me right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_34@I'm cumming... I’m cumming even though all you’ve done is such on my nipples... My body is so excited by your touch, coach...♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_35@Nadeshiko pants as she looks at me with lust-filled eyes. My crotch has swelled up long ago from all of Nadeshiko’s undisguised teasing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_36@Aaah... Coach, your cock is already standing so tall and proud...♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_37@Nadeshiko undoes my pants and licks her lips as she looks at my erect cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_38@I’m so horny right now... I want coach to get a good taste of my body...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_39@Nadeshiko rides me, enveloping my cock in her wet, soft pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_40@Mmm... Do you like how my pussy feels, coach...? I’ve been keeping it in good condition for you... It’s a bit fleshy, but it should feel amazing... I’m quite confident of that ♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_41@As Nadeshiko said, her pussy is plump and soft, and it clamps tightly on my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_42@Her pussy is so incredibly warm and wet. It overflows with her love juices that lubricate my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_43@I can't stand this rubbing anymore!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_44@Blood fills my brain as I thrust my hips to plunge my cock deep inside Nadeshiko’s pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_46@My sudden thrust make Nadeshiko moan out load. But she doesn’t reject me. Instead, her body relaxes to welcome my cock deeper inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_48@It's all the way in up the base... Nadeshiko, your pussy is amazing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_49@Yes... My body exists for you, coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_5@Nadeshiko looks at the call ended screen on her phone with eyes full of worry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_50@Coach, can I hold your hand...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_51@Nadeshiko makes a shy request like a gentle, obedient woman. Then we hold hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_52@I’m so happy... Coach... Can you put it in me... Aaahhhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_53@That’s when I lost the last of my rational mind. After I thrust my hips hard, I start plowing her pussy fiercely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_55@Nadeshiko’s giant breasts sway rhythmically along with our movements and her pussy keeps clenching onto me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_56@The stimulation and pleasure that travels through our bodies makes it impossible for us to stop. The only thing I can think of right now is to thrust my hips. Her moans of ecstasy fill my ears.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_57@Aaaahhh... This feels too good... I can’t take it anymore... I’m going to lose my mind...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_58@Under my relentless attacks, Nadeshiko becomes more and more lewd.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_59@The burning hot feeling of her pussy brings me closer to cumming.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_6@She caresses the cover of the book and makes up her mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_60@Aaaahhhh... Coach’s cock is expanding inside my pussy... Cum inside me! Give me all of your cum! Make me pregnant—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_62@Nadeshiko hugs my tightly, which pushes my cock into the deepest part of her pussy. At the same time, I shoot my load inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_63@Our passionate and breathtaking love-making ends with me filling her pussy with so much cum that it leaks out of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_64@Aaahhh... There’s so much...♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_65@Nadeshiko and I hug each other as we savor the feelings of our orgasms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_66@...What’s going on?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_67@I hear a man's voice all of a sudden and turn around to see that a man has appeared. Now that I look carefully, isn’t that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_68@!!?!?!! Chairman! Why are you here!?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_69@Although I’m shocked at his appearance, what I hear next hits me like a bolt of thunder from the sky.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_70@Daddy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_71@Nadeshiko doesn’t even attempt to hide the telltale signs of what we were just doing. She looks gently and resolutely at her father.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_72@Things are exactly as it looks... I can't live without player’s cock anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_73@My mind blanks as I finally realize that I've fallen into Nadeshiko’s trap.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_74@Having successfully tricked both men, Nadeshiko smiles mischievously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_75@I... Will continue to stay in this squad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_8@Nadeshiko, why did you suddenly ask me to come to the hotel?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P03_h3_9@Coach, I have something I need your help with...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_01@On a cool, dark night, a pair of brooding eyes stares at a trembling man.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_02@Sir, have you made up your mind?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_03@I... I'll just have this one...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_04@No problem. Your dish will be ready very soon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_05@The waitress's smile gave him a chill on his back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_06@Hey, is she new here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_07@Yeah, she started working here recently. Isn't she a cutie?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_08@Why did I have a chill in my back when she smiled at me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_09@The waitress, Catherine, heads back to the counter to tell her coworker the order they made, and goes on to the next table for their order.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_10@It has been a month since Catherine followed Sora and her church to Star City, yet she still has no clue where Sora would be.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_11@Despite her being a strong vampire, she still lives a tough life here in this strange place with no support from her tribe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_12@Sigh~ Where on earth is Sora~ I've been searching for her for a month...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_13@I really want to enjoy that wonderful taste again~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_14@What a splendid experience it was last time~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_15@After work, Catherine sighs at her tough life on the way home even as a vampire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_16@It's my payday today, so I decided to have a better meal! Therefore, I come to a restaurant in the mall.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_17@Soon after entering the restaurant, I'm led to a seat and taken orders by a waitress I haven't seen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_18@Good day. What would you like for today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_19@Ah, what's the special today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_20@Today's Special is Chef's Filet Mignon. I personally recommend having it medium-rare, so that you can taste the perfect texture with some blood...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_21@Well... Um... Guess I'll have a Today's Special, but I would like it medium... Thanks...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_23@For some reason, when the waitress looks at me with her brooding eyes, I feel pretty nervous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_24@The waitress is indeed a beauty, but her eyes just give me a chill in my neck... It's probably just the problem of my neck...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_25@After the meal, I pass by Sora's church on my way back to the dormitory, so I go inside to say hi.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_26@Oh, it's player, what a rare guest~ Are you here to hear the Goddess's inculcation?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_27@Haha, I just finished my lunch and thought about coming before heading back to the dorm... Has the number of believers increased recently?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_28@Yes, it's been increasing steadily. The evangelism is going pretty well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_29@Since player is here, would you like to bring some holy water back?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_30@Sora says when she goes to grab some bottles of holy water. Yet she stops in shock a few steps before me,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_31@... What's the matter? You look pretty strange... Do I smell that bad? I did sweat a little outside...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_32@I raise my arm and smell myself, but I don't smell anything bad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_33@player... Where did you go before coming?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_34@Sora stares thoroughly at me while walking around me in silence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_35@Um, I went for lunch in a restaurant in the mall... What? Don't scare me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_36@... player, did you meet anyone?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_37@Only a lot of strangers like passengers and waiters... But now that you're asking, I did feel a chill in my neck when a waitress in the restaurant looked at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_38@Could you tell me what that restaurant is? I really want to try it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_39@I'm pretty surprised by how urgent Sora sounds despite her smile. Does she want to try the meal there so bad...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_40@If you want to try it, how about we go there tomorrow? Their food does taste good. And it's my treat!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_41@... Since you're inviting me, let's go together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_42@Sora accepts my invitation after pondering for a while,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_43@I guess she's hesitating because she's not used to being treated by others as such an independent woman.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_44@Oh, and player, don't forget to bring the holy water with you. It brings you to the good and away from the bad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_45@Hm? Oh, okay, I will.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_46@Today I meet up with Sora at the church to go to the restaurant together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_47@It's here. Let's go in.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_48@I lead Sora into the restaurant. Just like yesterday, someone takes us to the seat, but I don't see that waitress yesterday.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_49@Which one is the waitress player mentioned yesterday?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_50@Hmm... She seems to be absent today... Ah! That one...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_51@I point at the waitress who took my order yesterday. Coincidentally, that waitress near us turns around and sees us at the same time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_52@... Sora?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_54@Fast and strong like a tornado, the waitress pounces at us... at Sora!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_55@Just when she is about to touch Sora, I pull Sora back behind me in reaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_56@The waitress pounces on me so hard that the tables around us are all messed up, and all the other customers are startled.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_1_57@Because of her, the surrounding of our seat has become such chaos!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_01@Ugh... It hurt so much...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_02@Her power was so strong that I feel my vertebrae is almost broken!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_03@Huuuuuhh?!~ Why are you brat coming between us? I wasn't looking for you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_04@The waitress presses herself on me with a scary face that looks like she is going to kill me immediately... What's more... her eyes are bloody red!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_05@When I try to push her away and sit up, I feel my chest wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_06@The small bottle of holy water I wear around my neck is broken by her... that why the holy water is flowing all over my chest!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_07@Sora~ I've been looking for you this whole month~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_08@The waitress's chest is also stained with the holy water because of how hard she pressed her body on mine. But different from mine, her wet chest is letting out smoke...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_09@What the hell...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_10@player, we should just leave first!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_11@Woah, wait! What on earth is happening here?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_12@Sora grabs my arm and drags me out with an expression that looks like we're doomed. Thanks to Sora's power, I can push away the waitress and stagger out following Sora.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_13@We run at our fastest speed until we get into a small alley far away from the mall.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_14@Here should be okay... player, are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_15@Pant, pant... Could you explain what just happened now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_16@This is really...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_17@It's okay. If you think it's not the right timing to tell me the details, you don't have to.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_18@Sora seems very hesitant about the current situation, so I don't want to force her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_19@It's not like I can't tell you... Her name is Catherine. She is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_20@Sora~! Here I come~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_21@When Sora sighs and is about to tell me the story, she is interrupted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_22@... Stay there. Don't come any closer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_23@This girl called Catherine is following us! What's her story with Sora...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_24@After such a long time, shouldn't we have a heartful hug first?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_25@It's just a month! And why are you following me?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_26@I'm genuinely devoted to you and your church! So I'll follow you wherever you go~ This is my promise to you as a vampire!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_27@Come~ Lash me again with your love~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_28@Vampire? Lash her with love? I have totally no idea what on earth Catherine is talking about.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_29@It really sounds like she has some mental issues. Is she stalking Sora or something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_30@Miss, I really don't mean to interrupt, but you'll have to stop whatever you're doing if Sora doesn't like it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_31@Yet again, Catherine stares at me with those bloody red eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_32@Are you... a believer in Sora's church?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_33@Huh? Um... I guess so?... Since I sometimes go there to help her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_34@I got it. Then we're going to the same church. Nice to meet you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_35@After hearing my answer, Catherine smiles as her eyes fade into their normal color.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_36@Catherine, look...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_37@Sora looks so troubled that I believe she wants to pull out her SMG really badly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_38@Now that you're a believer, and you've come to this city, you'll have to promise me some things.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_39@Sora~ Name it! I'll do whatever you say~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_40@For some reason, Catherine looks extremely excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_41@First, you can't disturb humans' life. What you did in the restaurant just now is not allowed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_42@Second, come to church only once a week.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_43@Third, stay at least ten steps away from me. Thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_44@What did Sora mean by she can't disturb humans' life? It sounds like she's a strange alien or something. Speaking of being strange, how her eyes change their color does look pretty strange. Can the contact lens nowadays do something like that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_45@Uhmm~ No problem! You'll still grant me lashes of love even when I'm ten steps away from you, won't you~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_46@... If you understand what I say, go back to the restaurant to help them clean up the mess. And be sure to do it well. You caused them big trouble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_47@Okay~ Then I'll visit your church next time! Don't forget to welcome me with the holy water~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_48@Catherine leaves reluctantly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_49@... player, I know you're really curious about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_50@Sora sighs again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_51@You might have figure out from our conversation that Catherine is not a human being. She's a vampire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_52@... So she really isn't a human...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_53@As a vampire, she's supposed to stay as far away from churches, but she "loves" church instead.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_54@Churches should treat everyone equally as long as they're following the good. That's why I'm so troubled.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_55@player, if you meet her in the church next time, could you secretly investigate why she is so enthusiastic about the church?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_56@Even though it's really hard to believe it, I now understand what's going on...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_57@Seeing how worried Sora looks, I guess I can only say yes to her request.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_2_58@Besides, I do feel a little bit curious about Catherine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_01@After accepting Sora's request, I go to church more often.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_02@I can see Catherine there in the church often as well. Probably because she sees me helping in the church many times, she is pretty friendly to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_03@Hi~ You're so devout today as well~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_04@Well, yeah, you too... But are you alright?! Is that cold sweat on your face?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_05@It's no-nothing! I'm good. This is the trial for me as a believer!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_06@We chat on a bench in the church.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_07@According to my observation, Catherine in the church always seems like she's undergoing some kind of... pain? Yet she looks excited about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_08@Is it because of the structure of the church? Can this building affect vampires' minds that much?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_09@What trial... Don't force yourself too much if you're not feeling well...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_10@I give Catherine a pack of tissues.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_11@Hehe... You're too naive!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_12@This kind of pure pain mixed with happiness is what makes your soul more devout!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_13@If you can't understand this, don't ever call yourself a devout believer!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_14@Okay, alright. I got it... Wipe off your sweat first...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_15@I just can't understand. You're a vampire, yet you're coming to church at the risk of being hurt or banished by your tribe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_17@Sometimes I... can't understand myself either...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_18@You... have a vampire tribe, don't you? What do other vampires think about your crazy love towards the church?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_19@Hmm, they can't understand it at all. Actually, I don't understand it either.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_20@A vampire passionate about churches, which are supposed to be her enemy... None of the vampires in my tribe agrees with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_21@Is it because the church means something special to you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_22@Well, I don't think so. My life doesn't have so much to do with the church before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_23@... I guess so. What kind of vampire would approach churches just to get themselves into trouble...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_24@No matter how inexplicable my love for the church is, I still have to say I appreciate Sora very much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_25@I know that vampires are supposed to be evil beings standing against churches.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_26@But Sora accepted me as who I am! This church gives me the happiness of being accepted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_27@I can understand that. Sora really has a heart of gold.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_28@After such a passionate speech, Catherine suddenly becomes silent.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_29@As if enduring some kind of pain, Catherine keeps sweating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_30@I suddenly think of how Catherine looked when the holy water splashed onto her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_31@By the way, are vampires pretty sensitive to the holy water?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_32@The holy water... It's one of my favorite rewards...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_33@... I mean... Does your skin hurt when it's exposed to the holy water?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_34@Instead of pain, I would say it's wonderful and heavenly happiness...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_35@I didn't get the exact answer to my question, but I think my assumption is right.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_36@Maybe the stimulation the holy water brings you is the key factor that makes you fond of churches.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_37@That's right! I like it! As a believer, my dream is to bathe in the holy water... with Sora...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_38@But this still doesn't prove why you become so excited as soon as you enter the church.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_39@Because you're not touching the holy water right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_3_40@I decide to ignore Catherine's nonstop compliment about the holy water and Sora. If I were Sora, I'll probably tackle this issue with an SMG...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_01@I ponder, believing that there must be a proper explanation as to why Catherine becomes so excited in the church.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_02@Perhaps I can also help Catherine with the reason figured.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_03@Catherine, how about we meet here again tonight?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_04@Aren't you curious about why you're so affected by the church and the holy water?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_05@I think there's an answer to this question!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_06@Besides my curiosity about Catherine's body condition, the investigation is also for Sora's request.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_07@I do feel curious about it... but the church is not opened at night.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_08@Of course we're sneaking in here! Nobody can know anything about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_09@But... Sora must be mad if she finds out about it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_10@So you actually care about whether she's mad or not? Anyways, you're always pissing her off, so she must be used to it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_11@I say while thinking about how to face the furious Sora should we get busted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_12@Catherine is an undying vampire, but I'm just a human being!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_13@Fine. I hope we can find the answer. However, I don't mind if we can't find anything. It won't affect my devoutness at all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_14@Soon, the night comes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_15@I meet Catherine at an inconspicuous corner outside the church.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_16@Coming to the church two times in a week is just an exciting miracle~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_17@You... don't get so hyped now! We're not even in the church yet!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_18@The gate of the church is locked. How are we supposed to get in?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_19@Huh? Aren't you a vampire? Don't you have any superpower? Like psychokinesis or something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_20@Of course, I don't have anything you said. Since I'm exposing myself to the air in the church this often, many of my vampire powers have been weakened.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_21@... Seems like a huge cost for you to come to church.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_22@Although I originally planned to get into the church by Catherine's superpower, I still prepared something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_23@Catherine, stand guard for me. Tell me if you see anyone approaching.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_24@I take out a master key from my pocket, slightly stick it into the lock on the gate, and gently rotate it while avoiding making any noise.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_25@On the other side, the over-excited Catherine keeps asking me to hurry up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_26@Finally, I hear a metal sound from the lock and lightly push open the gate.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_27@Ah~ This is the familiar smell of my love~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_28@Even though I've just been here this morning, my body and mind miss this smell so much!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_29@As soon as Catherine enters the church, she becomes painful and pleasant again with the cold sweat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_30@Be quiet... There's nothing special on the first floor. Let's get up to the second floor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_31@I lead the excited Catherine upstairs quietly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_32@We're not allowed to enter the second floor, as Sora says it's where some talismans and SMGs are stored.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_33@Ahh... The smell is getting thicker and thicker...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_34@Hey, are you alright? You look super painful!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_35@After getting up to the second floor, Catherine obviously looks like she's suffering from even greater pain.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_36@Yet her excitement seems to be doubled as well...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_37@No... I'm fine... I feel terrific...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_38@She can barely walk well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_39@Out of the blue, I hear someone stepping upstairs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_40@Right at the worst timing... Let's hide in this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_41@I drag Catherine, almost picking her up, and squeeze us into a room in the hallway.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_42@From the crack of the door, I can see Sora patrolling with a flashlight. If she finds us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_43@But surprisingly, Sora doesn't seem to sense Catherine's vampire smell.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_44@Are you okay...? Hey! What are you doing?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_45@Hehe~ I can sense the smell that makes me happy and painful at the same time from this cabinet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_46@I turn around and see Catherine sticking herself onto a seemingly ordinary wooden cabinet. With her clothes soaking wet with her sweat, her curves are slightly showing beneath her tight outfit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_47@Is there anything special about this cabinet?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_48@I open the cabinet and see Catherine's favorite holy water and... ointment?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_49@I've never seen ointment in the church before.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_50@I pick up the ointment and give it a closer look, noticing that Catherine becomes even more excited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_51@This smell... is the smell of this church...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_52@I sniff the ointment closely but don't feel anything special. However, after I open the jar, a thick fragrance fills the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_53@Ah, this smell is really the smell of the air in the church.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_54@It was probably the thick fragrance that covered Catherine's vampire smell when Sora passed by.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_55@When I'm thinking, Catherine suddenly grips my hand with the ointment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_56@With bloody eyes, she stared at the ointment that makes her painful but pleasant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_57@An idea comes to my mind. I apply the ointment on myself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_4_58@Catherine, I've got the answer. Let me tell you right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_01@自從空得知凱薩琳如此迷戀自己與教會的原因後，就決定更加遠離凱薩琳。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_02@然而凱薩琳卻總是在試探她的理智底線……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_03@非常感謝各位前來聆聽女神的教誨 ～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_04@那麼這裡有些聖水，如果有人有需要的話……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_05@我需要！我必須沐浴在這些聖水之下，才能得到被淨化的永生！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_06@凱薩琳擠開人群，朝正在對信徒們說話的空撲上去。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_07@信徒們尖叫連連，桌椅被撞歪，現場頓時變得像被子彈掃過。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_08@妳給我站好，不是告訴妳這樣會造成別人困擾嗎？！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_09@空拿著聖經擋在自己與凱薩琳中間，阻止凱薩琳把聖水全部抱走。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_10@但是…但是我太需要聖水了……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_11@你昨天才剛拿過兩瓶而已，你是喝掉了嗎？！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_12@僅僅兩瓶聖水，是不足以讓我的身心靈被完整淨化的…！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_13@我有著意志堅定的覺悟～！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_14@最該先被淨化的應該是你的腦喔？？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_15@欸欸小姐，妳這樣突然打斷很干擾大家欸～要拿聖水要好好排隊啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_16@蛤～你想阻撓我淨化身心嗎？你是魔鬼嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_17@凱薩琳一把抓起信徒的衣領，把信徒抓在半空中。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_18@其他信徒看見這一幕都開始燥動了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_19@…到底誰才是魔鬼。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_20@各位～今天先到此為止吧～！\n下一次我們再繼續一起宣讀女神的訓示～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_21@空連忙把看熱鬧不嫌事大的信徒們都趕出教堂。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_22@夠了，凱薩琳，給我老實跪下！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_23@呼呼～空，你終於要對我進行愛的教育嗎～？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_24@來吧！冥頑不靈的我的劣根性，需要女神的拯救～！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_25@我願意跪在這裡…一輩子……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_26@儘管凱薩琳聞到油膏氣味又冒著冷汗，她依然嚷嚷著一些讓空火大的話語。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_27@空露出了冷酷的神情，拿出十字架、聖水與油膏。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_1_28@既然這樣，那你就好好體會一下吧……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_01@在餐廳工作完後，凱薩琳走在回家的路上。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_02@欸～最近工作真是特別累呢～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_03@教會那邊也總是擠滿信徒～空又不准我一直過去～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_04@唉～日子好漫長啊，這種得不到的感覺～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_05@凱薩琳發現自己最近前往教會的次數越來越頻繁了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_06@但是空也因為信徒越來越多所以無暇顧及（教訓）她。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_07@真希望空和教會只屬於我呢……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_08@凱薩琳難得失落地無精打采。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_09@雖然得不到的感覺也這麼迷人～但果然還是想多得到一點關注呢……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_10@也許我應該暫時去旅行一下放鬆心情…找個時間去教會和空道別吧～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_11@於是凱薩琳在某天下午帶著道別的心情到了教會……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_12@空～這是給你的餞別禮物～！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_13@凱薩琳拿出了一本超厚重的書籍，似乎是某個宗教流派的教義。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_14@這是……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_15@空接過後，發現是她頗有興趣的書。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_16@等等，為什麼說是餞別禮物？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_17@啊，因為我想去旅行一陣子呢……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_18@旅行…？妳要離開這裡了嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_19@嗯…因為總覺得在這裡老是會讓你困擾…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_20@聽到凱薩琳要離開的消息，空突然感覺有點微妙。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_21@而且…我也開始想找點正經的事情做…畢竟身為血族的我…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_22@血族！是啊，身為血族的她，理所當然的就是要追逐力量，想辦盡辦法騙取人類的信任，將人類的血液變成她力量的養分…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_23@要是就這樣讓她離開的話…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_24@不行…！為了貫徹女神的正義！我只能犧牲我自己了！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_25@我聽到了一件可怕的事情…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_26@空…妳…妳的眼神…有點可怕…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_27@空蕩蕩的教堂瞬間充滿空的殺意。\n彷彿正在震動的空氣讓凱薩琳不禁顫抖了起來…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_28@啊啊～這個感覺…\n空的視線就像無數把刀子，想要割裂我刺穿我一樣…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_29@凱薩琳…\n身為女神的追隨者，我覺得我有這個必要，繼續對妳進行道德上的矯正！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_30@這次…我不會再讓妳跑出去為非作歹的！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P030_N_2_31@好…好的，我…我很樂意…啊啊～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_01@It was if the heavens had opened up, and the rain came pouring down in sheets. In a deafening roar of thunder, the dormitory blacked out and lost its power...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_02@As Coach of the team, it is my duty to console and quell the fears of the girls. I did my best to ignore the lightning ripping the sky apart and set off to throw the circuit breaker. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_03@I'm completely drenched... I'll need to take another shower again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_04@In one hand, I hold an umbrella that is a pitiful attempt at blocking the rain, and use the other free hand to navigate the back alley of the dormitory that is filled with piles of stuff. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_05@I finally reach the breaker and as I was fumbling with the umbrella to free up both hands, something moved out of the corner of my eye. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_06@...?! W-What...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_07@Caught off guard, I am startled by the sudden movement. Upon closer inspection, I discover that the shape is that of a—human?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_08@Hey! Are you alright? Are you hurt?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_09@After confirming that it is a girl, I hurriedly approach her and ask if she requires assistance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_11@The girl looks at me silently and shaked her head. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_12@Um... should I help you to the police station?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_13@The girl continues to shake her head and doesn't seem willing to talk. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_14@... I see, that's alright. Can you stand?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_15@Our dormitory isn't far from here, let's go back first. The girls there can help. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_16@I don't want to force the girl, so I reach out a hand tentatively. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_17@She stares silently at me for a while before finally taking my hand and getting up. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_18@I hope I'm not bringing back trouble...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_19@I think back to how our training facility was once destroyed by a girl in the team and how much money it took to fix it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_20@I bring this unknown girl back to the dormitory.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_21@Nadeshiko who came to greet us was surprised by the sudden visitor, but still considerately brought us towels to dry ourselves.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_22@Nadeshiko, there's something that I'm going to have to ask you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_23@Coach, you can ask me anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_24@I pull Nadeshiko away from the girl and explain how I found the stranger in the back alley.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_25@...that's basically the gist of it. She isn't willing to say anything, so I'm going to need to rely on you later. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_26@I believe that she might be more willing to open up to another girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_27@No problem, Coach. I'll do my best to comfort her. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_28@Nadeshiko smiles gently and brings the girl to an empty room. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_29@If it's Nadeshiko, she should be able to find out more about the girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_30@Can you tell me your name?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_31@Nadeshiko caringly helps the girl dry off her wet hair.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_32@...Sayaka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_33@The girl, Sayaka, frowns and hesitates a bit before opening her mouth to answer. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_34@Can I get you a cup of hot milk?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_36@Sayaka reluctantly nods her head as if unable to resist Nadeshiko's kindness. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_37@Nadeshiko smiles as she watches Sayaka finish the milk. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_38@Where are you from?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_39@If you can't say right now, it's alright. I understand. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_41@Sayaka once again falls into silence. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_42@That's alright. You can always tell me when you're ready. You should get some rest!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_43@As Nadeshiko picks up the finished cup of milk and was ready to leave the room, Sayaka finally slowly opens her mouth to speak...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_44@I wait for Nadeshiko in the lounge. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_45@Nadeshiko! How'd it go?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_46@Well... Her name is Sayaka, and she's a completely normal girl. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_47@I must say that her situation is a bit complicated. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_48@Ahh... By complicated, do you mean something similar to Sora...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_49@I reminiscenced about when Sora's church first moved to the neighborhood and trouble would often come looking. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_50@Or about that time when Catherine wouldn't stop stalking Sora...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_51@Hehe, none of the above.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_52@Nadeshiko let out a light chuckle. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_53@Sayaka used to be a soccer player, but was asked by her boss to fix the match. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_54@She refused and was subsequently released from the team. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_55@She is a girl of resolve and firm beliefs. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_56@OK... Have Sayaka stay at the dorm until she's fully recovered!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_57@Thank you, Nadeshiko. Please take her under your care. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_58@No problem, Coach. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_1_59@I remember Sayaka's eyes devoid of fear when I first met her in that back alley amidst the pouring rain. She really is a stubborn girl. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_01@The following day it was a sunny afternoon when I knocked on Sayaka's door. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_02@Hey Sayaka, there're snacks in the lounge. Why don't you come join us?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_03@Even if Nadeshiko had explained to me Sayaka's situation, I still believed that I should personally check in on her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_04@I sat on a sofa in the lounge as I waited for Sayaka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_05@Sayaka, come sit down~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_06@I wave at Sayaka to come sit next to me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_07@Sayaka seems to still be wary of me, but compared to her taciturn 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_08@I don't think I've properly introduced myself... I'm the Coach of this Squirt Gun Team, and Nadeshiko is the team secretary.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_09@If there's anything on your mind at all, don't worry about it and feel free to reach out to us. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_10@I try my best to act as caring as possible. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_11@... OK, thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_12@Nadeshiko has told me about your story. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_13@May I ask what you have planned for the future?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_14@I-I want to join a new soccer team in Star City and continue to play ball. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_15@Before I find a team... could I stay here for a while?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_16@I can help run errands...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_17@There's no need for that! I wanted to discuss this issue with you too. I know that you have problems of your own. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_18@You're free to stay here until you find a team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_19@On that note... I also won't object to you helping out. My office desk is a little... messy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_20@A smile finally blooms on Sayaka's face. This is the first time that I see another expression on her face that isn't one of caution. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_21@For the past couple of nights that Sayaka has been here, whenever I passed by the training grounds, I could see her focused in her training. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_22@Today, I met the elated Sayaka in the dorm lobby. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_23@Do you come bearing good news, Sayaka? You look elated. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_24@That's right! I finally received notice to try out for a soccer team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_25@They just so happen to also be the best team in town!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_26@Wow! That's awesome! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_27@When's the try-out?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_28@I'll be heading over in a bit. The location's in a downtown high rise building.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_29@Oh...? I just happen to have errands to run in the vicinity. Why don't I give you a ride?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_30@Sayaka could hardly contain her excitement as she rode along to her try-out. I was silently cheering for her all along the way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_31@I looked on as Sayaka went on into the office and I headed off to run my own errand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_32@The next time I saw Sayaka, a gloom had settled over her face. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_33@Hey Sayaka, how did the try-out go?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_34@...Um, I guess it went alright.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_35@Although Sayaka said that everything was alright, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_36@Is that so... Then we should celebrate! I'll treat you to some delicious food!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_37@Even someone as unobservant as I could notice that there was something wrong with Sayaka. But if she didn't want to say anything, then I won't be the one to force her to talk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_38@Sayaka's mind was filled with thoughts regarding what just happened during the interview and the barrage of questions she faced.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_39@Can you tell me the reason that you left your previous team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_40@I... it was because we didn't share the same ideals...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_41@I've heard that you... didn't perform well in your last team? Is it because you can't handle pressure?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_42@That's...! No, that's not what it is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_43@We reached out to your previous team, and they said some pretty unflattering things about you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_45@You should know of our team's reputation. Do you think you're cut out for this team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_46@We're the top team in the area and we require the top talents. Do you think you're a top talent?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_47@Are you really a good soccer player?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_48@Sayaka fell silent in the face of this string of questions. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_49@All of these questions piled up in a wave and crashed towards Sayaka, breaking and eroding away at her hard-built confidence and courage. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_2_50@I was oblivious to Sayaka's inner turmoil as I enjoyed my meal. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_01@Ever since Sayaka came back from her interview, she had been acting strangely. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_02@I found out that she stopped practicing... but this wasn't the weirdest thing yet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_03@Recently, Sayaka started asking about the Squirt Gun team. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_04@player, can you tell me more about the Squirt Gun competition rules?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_05@What is your usual training regimen? What is your preferred method to train lung capacity?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_06@Wait... You're asking too many questions. One at a time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_07@Why are you suddenly so interested in the Squirt Gun Competition? Are you interested in joining?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_08@I jokingly ask Sayaka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_09@Yet, her expression is suprisingly serious. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_10@If possible... I would like a chance to join!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_11@Eh? Are you serious?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_12@I can't help but feel excited at the prospect of Sayaka joining the team. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_13@I've seen Sayaka's soccer training and believe that she has a very solid foundation. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_14@If Sayaka joined the team, she would be of great help.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_15@What about soccer?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_16@I-I also want to try other sports.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_17@Who says that I can only play one sport?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_18@Well, if you put it that way...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_19@I still think that something is off, but if Sayaka insists I don't have a reason to refuse. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_20@We have a practice match tomorrow afternoon. Why don't you come try out?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_21@No problem! I will give it my all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_22@I don't know why I feel a sense of foreboding seeing Sayaka's serious face...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_23@The following afternoon, the team started a practice match after warming up. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_24@I told Sayaka before hand of the Squirt Gun competition rules and had also shown her clips of previous battles. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_25@Ready... Start!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_26@The girls started practicing like always.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_27@Sayaka could be seen flitting around the battefield. If I didn't know better I would never have believed that this was her first time competiting. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_28@She even earned a couple of points for the team. Her perseverance and drive was a sight to behold. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_29@Sayaka is really something, isn't she?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_30@If we can get her to stay in the team, she'll be a great asset!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_31@Nadeshiko complimented Sayaka from the sidelines. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_32@Great minds think alike... I have the exact same thoughts. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_33@But we still need to respect Sayaka's wishes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_34@Who doesn't like a girl that can be put onto the battefield right away. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_35@As the battle ended, everyone left the field. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_36@I sat on the sideline and chatted with Sayaka. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_37@What do you think? Is it different from what you imagined?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_38@Squirt Gun competitions are really interesting, it reminds me of running on the soccer pitch. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_39@Is that so... Then why don't you join our team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_41@I'm just kidding~ Speaking of which, I haven't seen you practice soccer in a while.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_42@So player has noticed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_43@Hmm... Did something happen during your last try-out?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_44@Did someone pick on you?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_45@That's not it! I was just asked a couple of questions during the interview that I couldn't answer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_46@It isn't anything serious, but I'm just unsure of my own abilities. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_47@Maybe I'm just not cut out for soccer, and I'm just just chasing a dream. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_48@I don't think that's a bad thing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_49@But only you know the answer hidden in your heart. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_3_50@I pat Sayaka's shoulder and do my best to console her with my words. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_01@It seems I still can't put down soccer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_02@In the interview they asked me if I really had what it takes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_03@I wanted to tell them that I did! But for some reason I was unable to speak my mind. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_04@Maybe it is because I just don't have enough passion as I believe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_05@I look at Sayaka with her head hung low and try to think of a way to cheer her up. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_06@That's why I chose to distract myself through competing in Squirt Gun competitions. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_07@It looks like I still have some talent as a Squirt Gun player. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_08@I can't take the self-depreciating tone of Sayaka any longer. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_09@I whip out a water gun and start spraying her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_10@If you like soccer so much then you have to give it your all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_11@Is this all you've got?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_12@If you give up just because of some nobodys, will you be able to live with yourself for the rest of your life?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_14@Sayaka screams out and tries to block my water gun with her hands. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_15@I continue my verbal barrage as I empty the water gun. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_16@Next, under Sayaka's wide eyes, I pick up a soccer ball and throw it to her. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_17@Let's have a match!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_18@You can give up only after you've beaten me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_20@Sayaka stared at me for a long time before finally letting out a smile. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_21@Are you sure you want to challenge me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_22@As soon as Sayaka touches the ball, an air of confidence overcomes her. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_23@As for me... I don't think I have ever scored a goal before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_24@I'm not scared of you! The loser has to pay for dinner!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_25@This afternoon I played soccer with Sayaka. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_26@The sun shined brightly on her face and made her smile dazzling. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_27@Sayaka is always full of passion and has a unfaltering drive towards soccer. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_28@I kicked a ball that went wide. In order to stop it from rolling off, Sayaka slid to stop the ball. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_29@Her knee rubbed against the ground... it must burn!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_30@Are you OK? I'm sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_31@I'm fine, it's just a little scratch. Oh... it does hurt a little. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_32@Let's go back to my office, I'll help you dress the wound. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_33@I help Sayaka hobble back to my office. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_34@Some sweat beads on her forehead and her soft supple body leans against mine. My heart can't help but flutter a little. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_35@It's a good thing the wound isn't too serious. I'm so sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_36@It looks like player needs to brush up on his soccer skills~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_37@I-I will definitely do that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_38@...player, thank you so much. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_39@Don't sweat it. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_40@I kneel down to help apply the medicine to her wound. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_41@Sayaka's skin is supple and a healthy tanned color. I can't bear to tear my eyes away...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_42@player! What's wrong? Is there something on my feet?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_43@She takes my hand and slightly leans forward towards me. Her hot breath tickles my face. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_4_44@In order to help treat her wound, my fingers can't help but lightly touch her soft skin...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_1@Sayaka just received a new try-out invitation for a soccer team and was nervously excited. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_10@At complete odds with her normal confident self on the field, Sayaka looks at me beseechingly while sitting at the edge of my bed. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_11@She is wearing a thin airy night gown that only serves to accent the rise and fall of her chest due to her nervous breathing. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_12@If that's the case, I know of a special massage that can relax the body. Do you want to give it a try?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_13@If it is player, I'm open to try anything...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_14@Sayaka automatically removes her gown and only her lingerie remains to cover her huge mounds. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_15@Your training really shows in your body... such perky breasts, such a slim waist, and no extra fat to be found.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_16@I start massaging Sayaka's shoulders and she gradually relaxes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_17@player your hands are so warm... I can feel my stress slipping away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_18@Sayaka let out a content sigh and relaxed into my massage. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_19@How about here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_2@At night when I was in my room preparing some files for the Squirt Gun competition, a knock sounded at my door. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_20@I work my way down from Sayaka's smooth shoulders until I reach her breasts hidden underneath her bra.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_21@I can feel her nipples perking up even from underneath the fabric.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_22@Ahhh... player, wait...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_23@ Sayaka couldn't help letting out a slight moan and her body quivers under my touch. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_24@I slip my hand underneath her bra and I can feel her excitement from her nipples even more clearly. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_25@My hands sink into the soft flesh and fully take in Sayaka's soft and supple breasts. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_26@How is my technique? Shall I give you a deeper massage?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_27@I push Sayaka who is feeling too good to resist down onto the bed and remove her panties. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_28@Her pink pussy glistens from her love juices. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_29@Oh~ It looks like you're already wet. Has your body given up already?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_3@Sayaka? What's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_30@I caress the opening of Sayaka's pussy that is leaking translucent juices. Her warm wet hole is like a silent invitation. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_31@Mhmm... I'll never give... Ahhh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_32@Sayaka clings tightly to the bed sheets as her lower body writhes in pleasure from the touch of my fingers. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_33@In response, I spread her legs even wider. Sayaka's well-toned yet soft thighs provide no resistance to my whims. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_34@Even the sheets are soaked. Does it really feel that good?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_36@Sayaka unconsciously wants to close her legs, but is unable to escape from my grip. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_37@I unzip my fly to pull out my raging boner and rub it against Sayaka's trembling pussy. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_38@Sayaka's eyes glaze over from the pleasure and she can't help but let out sultry moans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_39@Just say the word, Sayaka, and I'll put it in. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_4@player... I can't sleep...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_40@Sayaka shyly turned her head away and tried to resist the cock rubbing against her pussy as she hesitated to open her mouth. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_41@Her hips gave in to her inner lust and started to rub back against my cock. I could barely hold myself back from sticking my cock into her pussy right there and then...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_42@I stick the tip of my cock in and feel the moist hot pussy coil against me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_43@Hah... player... put it all in...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_44@I raise Sayaka's leg high into the air and her plump ass and pussy is laid bare for me to see. Her pussy drools in need. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_45@I plunge my cock deeper in one motion and fill her tight slit. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_46@Ahh... You're filling me up... Hah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_47@Sayaka wraps her legs around my waist and grinds against me, attempting to gain even more pleasure from the act.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_48@I start to pump my hips rhythmically and love juices drench where my cock and Sayaka's pussy is connected. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_49@I plunge my cock as far as it will go and then pull out so that the tip is at the mouth of Sayaka's pussy. After a few rounds, my cock is already hard as a rod. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_5@Why don't you come in first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_50@Mhmm... Ahhh... S-Slow down a bit...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_51@Hah... What a slutty body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_52@Sayaka moans as if begging me to stop, but her body is giving me mixed signals by moving to match my motions. Her breasts jiggle from the impact of my thrusts. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_53@My large cock pounds in and out of Sayaka's tight hole and is accompanied by lewd wet sounds from her pussy. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_54@I can't resist increasing the speed of my hips and Sayaka's moans also increase in volume. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_55@I can't take it much longer... Ah... Ahh... Mhmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_56@The sound of our bodies bumping together only serves to increase the lewdness of the scene. The pleasure coursing through my cock from Sayaka's moist and burning pussy is almost too much to bear. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_57@Sayaka can't contain her voice any longer as she rushes towards climax. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_58@Ahhhhhh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_59@Her pussy is completely filled with my hot semen, and overflows as I pull out. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_6@I waited for Sayaka to come in before asking again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_60@I look at Sayaka crumpled on the bed and there is a face of contentment as she basks in the afterglow of her climax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_61@What do you think? Was this method effective?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_62@Sayaka murmurs to herself with a gleam in her eyes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_63@Ahh... Cock... player's cock... It's so wonderful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_7@Come sit. What's on your mind?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_8@The try-out is just around the corner and I can't help but be nervous. My mind is full of thoughts about soccer. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h1_9@Is there anything player can do to help me alleviate the stress...? I'm down to try anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_1@That afternoon, I played another round of soccer with Sayaka and she accidently tripped while trying to save the ball. Sayaka always gives it her all in soccer and she never holds back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_10@Let me check to see if you are hurt anywhere else...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_11@I push Sayaka down onto my office table and things scatter everywhere. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_12@Sayaka uses her hands to keep her body upright as I caress the inner part of her thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_13@An athlete's body is amazing! You're so stable while even in such a tiring position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_14@Mhmm... It feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_15@Sayaka's body seems to be even more sensitive after exercising. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_16@Her soft thighs rub against my waist and I can't resist taking off her pants. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_17@Your panties are soaked already. It must be quite uncomfortable. Do you need me to help you get out of them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_18@Sayaka still hasn't recovered from my sweet caress, but her love juices is already leaking through her panties. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_19@I pull Sayaka closer to rub my cock against her pussy, and my rod is covered in a sheen of her love juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_2@I bring Sayaka back to my office to treat the scrape on her knee. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_20@Ahh, hah... player... I thought you were going to help treat my wound...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_21@Sayaka's eyes are two slits of pleasure as she can barely keep them open. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_22@I did say that... let me use my cock to help treat you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_23@My hard cock rubs back and forth at the entrance of Sayaka's pussy and quivers in anticipation of entering her hole. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_24@I remove Sayaka's soaked panties and plunge my cock deep into her pussy. Her wet pussy greets my thick hard cock as it takes the entire length. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_25@Ahhh.... I-It's so hot... It feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_26@I thrust in and out a few times and then pull out a bit to see my cock is covered in a coat of love juices. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_27@Love juices drip from where my cock and Sayaka's pussy is connected. Her pink pussy is completely exposed for me to see in all of its glory. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_28@Hah... Hmm... Why did you stop?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_29@Sayaka frowns with her eyes still closed and squirms her hips in disapproval of me stopping.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_3@This might sting a little, bear with me now. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_30@I plunge my cock into her once more and pick up the speed. Her pussy contracts and clamps down on my cock. Love juices continue to gush from her pussy in a stream. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_31@Under my fierce attack, Sayaka lets out moan after moan. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_32@Her bouncy ass lets out a lewd sound from the constant impact of our bodies.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_33@Ah, ah, ah... Ahhh... Your cock is so thick...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_34@Sayaka's pussy sucks on my cock and the pleasure from the friction builds up. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_35@Hah... Hah... Sayaka, your pussy is so tight...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_36@Sayaka's love juices splash everywhere from my fierce pounding and even gets on her writhing body. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_37@My cock tirelessly pounds away and a wet thumping sound can be heard. As I step up the attack, Sayaka can't help but moan in pleasure. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_38@Ahh... Hah... More... Give me more... Ahhh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_39@Sayaka's unguarded expression is completely different than her usual self, and I have to say that she is looking very cute.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_4@It's OK. I can take it. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_40@Her moans and encouragements that she can't keep down just serve to excite my engorged cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_41@I grab Sayaka's waist and begin my final sprint.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_42@The wet sound of our bodies increases along with our lust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_44@Sayaka whimpers and wraps her legs tightly around my waist. Her tits sway with the motion and her whole body works to better take my cock. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_45@My need to release reaches a peak and I pump my hips furiously. Finally unable to resist any longer, I let out a roar and thrust forward one last time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_46@My cum instantly fills Sayaka's pussy and overflows, dripping down to her ass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_48@Sayaka climaxes at the same time and arches her back from the pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_49@Her climax washes over her and she can only pant helplessly. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_5@I apply some ointment to my fingers and slather it on the smooth and supple skin of Sayaka's legs. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_50@Pant... Maybe this treatment really is effective...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_6@My fingers sink into the soft flesh of Sayaka's thighs. Her well-toned skin is pleasant to the touch and silky smooth.   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_7@I unconsciously stroke Sayaka's leg and I can feel the heat emanating from her body.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_8@player... what...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_h2_9@I take in Sayaka's slender figure before me with her legs spread wide open. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_01@這天下午，沙也加一如往常在無人的練習場練習著。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_02@player有空嗎？可以陪我練習一下嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_03@喔，好啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_04@我從地上撿起足球，向沙也加拋去。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_05@最近有收到新的面試通知嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_06@嗯！有，下周要面試。雖然不是很大的隊伍，但…我還是想去試試看。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_07@這樣也不錯，慢慢來，一定有機會的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_08@對了，不如讓戰隊的大家也一起來一場友誼賽吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_09@畢竟你總不能讓球技生疏了對吧？大家來踢一場，也能讓你找回感覺吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_10@欸，真的可以嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_11@可以啦哪次不可以～戰隊裡有不少人也是運動神經很好的喔～！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_12@那、那就麻煩大家了…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_13@我向撫子說明這件事，而她很快地租借到了足球場。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_14@在友誼賽當天，由撫子作為裁判，我也跟著下場踢球。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_15@那麼，比賽開始！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_16@撫子吹響了哨音打破場內一觸即發的氣氛。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_17@而沙也加立刻以迅雷不及掩耳的速度向我襲來！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_18@原來這就是沙也加在正式上場時的模樣啊……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_19@球在我腳上，而我奮力地躲避著沙也加的窮追不捨！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_20@player！猶豫是會敗北的～！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_21@我腳邊的球冷不防被靈敏的沙也加截走…我半放棄似地停下來喘氣。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_22@其他人則緊追著沙也加。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_23@呼…原來那天水槍比賽練習，和沙也加正面對峙的感覺是這樣啊……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_24@呵呵，教練在偷懶嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_25@撫子在一旁輕笑著。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_26@我休息一下嘛……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_27@被抓包了，我只好再次加入火熱的戰局。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_28@下半場我作為守門員，極力防堵著敵方的進攻。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_29@但是我的對手可是沙也加啊－－！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_31@沙也加用專注而堅定的眼神看著我，然後踢出那致命的一球！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_32@喔！超痛……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_33@那一球正好不偏不倚擊中我的跨下，我痛到差點原地往生啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_34@對不起！你沒事吧？是不是很痛？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_35@這、這不是廢話嗎……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_36@我心裡吐槽著…直接命中這種事真的很可怕啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_37@沙也加，你扶教練回房吧！大家比賽先暫停哦！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_38@撫子不慌不忙地打點混亂場面。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_39@而沙也加因長年運動而有力的手臂此刻正攙扶著我。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_40@房間裡，我躺著稍作休息。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_41@而沙也加擔心地靠近。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_1_42@該做些什麼，你才會舒服一點呢……？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_01@這天傍晚，我在大廳遇見正在看電視的沙也加。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_02@她看起來心情不錯，於是我詢問了她的近況。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_03@對了，你上次面試的那個足球隊有錄取你嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_04@嗯！我被錄取了！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_05@多虧了大家陪我練習找回手感～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_06@是因為你本來就有那個實力啦。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_07@那你去看過他們的環境了嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_08@看過了，環境還不錯～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_09@雖然這是個小隊伍，但他們願意給我很好的待遇和資源。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_10@我也很感謝player你和撫子，幫了我很多忙……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_11@我們也只是做能做到的事，剩下的還是你自己的堅持。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_12@當時要不是有player鼓勵我，我一定早就放棄了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_13@你是說我拿水槍射你嗎？還跟你邀戰足球……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_14@誰會突然掏出水槍亂噴啊！我真的嚇到了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_15@總之恭喜妳了！請你吃一頓飯慶祝一下吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_16@不，應該是我來請才對！畢竟找到工作了嘛～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_17@沙也加此刻的笑容非常耀眼。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_18@我們約定隔天中午一起去餐廳吃飯。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_19@player請入座～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_20@咳，謝謝……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_21@餐廳裡，沙也加為我拉開椅子。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_22@這還是我第一次被女孩子拉椅子啊…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_23@沙也加對我行了個禮，那有點調皮的樣子，讓我忍不住笑出來。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_24@對了，我還沒有跟你說過我為什麼會喜歡足球吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_25@其實我第一次接觸足球已經是國中體育課的事情了，是不是比你想像得還要晚很多？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_26@那時的體育老師很細心地教大家踢足球，讓我印象深刻。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_27@在場上踢著球奔跑雖然會喘會累，但迎面而來的風會讓我忘記疲累。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_28@在球場上和對手對峙的危機感、把球成功踢進球門的成就感，都使我欲罷不能～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_29@贏了就開心慶祝，輸球了就向對手討教，然後繼續練習。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_30@在球場上就要全力以赴拿下勝利！這是我一直懷抱著的想法。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_31@吃完飯後，我們到餐廳附近散步消化一下胃裡的食物。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_32@天氣正好，我們漫步到附近的公園裡。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_33@沙也加，你閉上眼睛，我變個魔術給你看！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_34@欸，變魔術還要閉眼睛，這麼神秘啊～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_35@因為這是個很特別的魔術啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_36@沙也加帶著期待的笑容閉上眼睛。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_37@我則趁這段時間在附近採了許多蒲公英。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_38@我拿著蒲公英，在沙也加面前輕輕吹了一口。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_39@蒲公英紛紛飛往沙也加的方向，像夏日裡的白色雪花。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_40@是蒲公英……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_41@沙也加睜開眼睛，抬起手輕輕去抓漫天飛舞的蒲公英。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P031_N_2_42@蒲公英隨風飄到新的地方，也會孕育出新的希望吧……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_01@After buzzing around the city for different meetings about water gun competitions, I choose to take a slow walk on the route I usually take when I go back to the dormitory.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_02@Just when I'm thinking about whose training status I should ask about first after getting back, a strong wind suddenly blows away my scarf that was tied loosely on my neck.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_03@A-Achooo!! Crap, my scarf...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_04@Turn around immediately, I see my scarf stuck on the branch of a tree and fluttering upon the wind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_05@Good. It's not flying to somewhere far away... Umph!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_06@It's not a tall tree, so I'm able to reach my scarf just by standing on my tiptoes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_07@It's getting so colder recently. I'm not wearing warm enough for the weather today, so it's better to go back now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_08@Thinking about the warmth the girls can give me, I speed up on my steps.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_10@The next morning, when I'm about to go out for breakfast, I see Yui, who seems to have something on her mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_11@Ugh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_12@Yui, what happened?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_13@Woah! Coach...\nWell... I saw something weird...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_14@Weird? Weird how?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_15@Last night I came back later than usual because of some idol events.\nWhen I was heading to my room for sleep, I heard some strange noises...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_16@So I turned around, and saw a cup on the table in the living room floating!!\nI was completely stupified there! But after a few seconds, it slowly landed where it had originally been...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_17@Then I ran back to my room because I was too terrified.\nThis morning when I told everyone about it, no one believed me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_18@A floating cup... Did you take a photo of it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_19@I was too scared to do so! Coach! Who on earth could think of taking a picture under that circumstance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_20@Well, we've never done anything bad, so if ghosts really exist, I don't think they'll come to mess with us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_21@Yui, could it be that you were so tired that you saw some delusion?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_22@Even Coach is saying something like this... I, I really saw it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_23@Yui's disappointed look makes me start to feel guilty.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_24@No matter the cup really floated or not, it's better for you to take some rest earlier today.\nShould it happen again, tell me and I'll help you the best I can.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_25@Yui nods and leaves with her lip pursed, looking upset. \nHowever, after only a day, I realize that I was totally wrong this morning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_27@Coooooach! Crap! There's a ghost in our dorm!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_28@Meow~ Luna is scared meeeew──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_29@What's going on? Why are you both looking so panicked?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_30@I... I got up last night because I wanted to use the toilet, but I heard some strange noises from the kitchen...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_31@So I sneaked to the kitchen and saw the utensils moving on their own!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_32@Luna also saw it! She's the witness!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_33@It's true meow! Luna couldn't fall asleep so I came out and saw Miyu staring at something outside the kitchen.\nI was curious about what she was looking at, so Luna entered the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_34@And I saw the frying pan frying an egg by itself mew! It was like someone invisible cooking there, meroooow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_35@The scariest thing was that, the invisible person sprinkled sugar on the egg instead of salt!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_36@Then a plate with the egg floated onto the dining table.\nNo one dares use the utensils after hearing about the story.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_37@So what Yui saw was not a delusion?... Let's go check the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_38@I follow the two terrified girls to the kitchen, which looks like it was just ravaged by a typhoon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_39@Someone did cook here, seeing the eggshell's still here...\nThe cabinet and the fridge are also a mess. Looks really like something Luna would do when she first came.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_40@Meroow! Luna didn't make such a mess!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_41@Then we head to the dining room, where a plate of the fried egg was placed on the table.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_42@Hmm. We can't get any information from the egg, so I should try it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_43@Coach?! Aren't you worried about food poisoning or any curse on this egg?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_44@A small egg won't harm me that much. Should anything happen to me, just get Rise and Alice to help me. We do have masters in various areas in our team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_45@Despite the words I just said, my smile fades away as soon as I take a small bite of the egg.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_46@It's terrible! How can someone make such a terrible fried egg?!\nInstead of "having no talent on cooking," this person "sucks at cooking"!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_47@Mew? Coach, are you okay?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_48@I'm fine... We can't know it's really a ghost or a prank by a human now, but it's suspicious that someone would barge into our dorm and make this kind of horrible food for us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_49@Besides, I can't allow this person to scare you again, so this incident should end as soon as possible.\nLeave it to me. I'll catch this person tonight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_50@Woah~ Coach looks so cool now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_1_51@What will happen tonight? I'll sit and wait.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_01@To fix the "was that a ghost?" incident bothering the girls, I decided to sacrifice my sleep tonight to close the case.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_02@To avoid startling that person, I only have the three witnesses hiding at a spot waiting for that person to appear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_03@We've been waiting for so long... Coach, will that guy appear again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_04@I don't know. But since he was seen by us the last two days, there's a chance that he'll come again today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_05@I'm starting to doze off...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_06@Shh! Luna heard something meow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_07@(Pitter-patter... Pah! Clank!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_08@It's going into the kitchen again?! That thing must be thinking about making some horrible food!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_09@You girls wait right here. I'll go check the situation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_10@I stand up with determination and stalk towards the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_12@Lalala~ Hams taste good~ And smells good as well~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_13@I've never seen anything like this in my life.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_14@The stove is on, the ham is fried in the pan, and the spatula is floating in the air.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_15@No way. I have to calm down first. This must be Alice's magic, or Grace's... or Monica's...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_16@When I'm convincing myself, I see a bag of sugar flying towards the frying pan. Meanwhile, the ham starts to let out a burned smell because it's not flipped in time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_17@It's still not too late to rescue the ham from becoming a disaster!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_18@Hey! I don't care who you are, but you have to stop!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_19@Ah... Am I busted? He looks furious... What do I do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_20@Well... I can explain. I mean no harm, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_21@You want to keep silent? Put everything down right now, or I'll consider you hostile and start to defend our dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_22@You hear me? Don't try to challenge my temper. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_23@Crap! He can't hear me...\nFire... How can I turn this off... Waaah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_24@The fire on the stove becomes even bigger. To avoid any further accident, I dash forward to turn off the stove.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_25@Okay! Enough is enough... huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_26@I turn around and see the word "Sorry" written with ketchup next to the stove.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_27@So that thing is not hostile?\nMaybe I should have realized when I didn't have diarrhea after eating that horrible fried egg.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_28@Stay here. I'll go get paper and a pen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_30@After getting paper and a pen, I ask the girls to follow me to the kitchen so that they can also understand what's happening.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_31@Are you still here? From now on, you can answer our questions by writing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_32@First of all, what's your name? And how did you get into our dorm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_33@Ahh... It's been a long time since the last time I held a pen. My handwriting must be worse than the ones written with ketchup.\nHope he can understand what I'm writing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_34@I'll try to write now! My name is... "Berry."\nAnd then... "Followed the scarf."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_35@Wow. This handwriting looks like an elementary student's.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_36@Miyu, you might hurt her feeling by saying that.\nIf she's called "Berry," I think she must be a cute girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_37@Followed by the scarf? So has she been here since the day my scarf was blown away? I suddenly feel creepy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_38@Hm... So you know the short tree near the park down the street?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_39@The words that are written down startled all of us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_40@<color=#B22222>"Yes. I died on that tree."</color>
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_42@Waaaaaahh! It's really a ghost!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_43@I... I can't...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_44@Miyu!\nCoach... Sorry, but I should take Miyu back to her room!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_45@Well, Luna will help mew!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_46@The three girls left the kitchen in a hurry, looking like they were fleeing away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_47@But as the Coach of them, I can't run away like they did. \nSo I continue talking to the ghost.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_48@Then, why did Berry follow my scarf and come here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_49@Why...? It's a little bit embarrassing to say it, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_50@Because all the people around me were busy sending me to the hospital, I lost my favorite scarf somewhere.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_51@So I had been looking for it near the tree every day, and I finally saw a scarf flying towards me. I thought it was mine, so...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_52@What color is your scarf?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_53@It's pink. A long scarf with white dots that make it look like a strawberry.\nIt's very important to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_54@I try to imagine Berry's scarf, but it's nothing similar to my scarf.\nHow can she mistaken mine as hers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_55@After following the scarf, I found many people living here.\nAnd I think if I want you to help me, I should help you in advance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_56@So I decided to start from making you guys breakfast.\nBut it didn't go well at all... I'm really sorry!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_57@Now I know how dorky this ghost is.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_58@I understand the situation now. Thanks for your cooperation.\nI don't like leaving problems hanging there, so you can leave it to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_2_59@Even though I promise Berry to find her scarf, I don't think I can make it in my heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_01@Excuse me. Did you see a scarf looking like this before?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_02@Alright... It's okay. Thank you for your time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_04@It'll be hard to find it, but we still put it on the record. If someone sends this scarf here, I'll call you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_05@Thank you very much!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_06@I've looked for someone's missing pet before, and now I'm looking for someone's missing scarf.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_07@To find Berry's scarf, I've asked the residents near that street door by door and reported this case to the police station and train station.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_08@At first, my motivation was simple. I didn't want to leave any pity on this girl who died young.\nBut I didn't expect myself to devote so much time and energy like I do now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_09@However, I still haven't gotten any information.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_11@I'm back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_12@Thank you for your work today as well! Mr. player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_13@Just after putting down my shoes, I see a marker flying towards me and writing down the words on the whiteboard on the wall.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_14@Thank you. Berry's handwriting is more and more pretty.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_15@Since that day, I'm getting used to having an invisible new friend in the dorm.\nThis news has also been spread around the girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_16@How magical. After she's here, I feel like my existence has become more obvious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_17@There are different reactions from the girls. Some are still worried and some think it's not a big deal.\nAnd some feel curious about her like Fuuko.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_18@Hearing Fuuko's cute words, I can't help smiling until Luna's question brings me back to reality.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_19@player, still no mews today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_20@Ah, yeah. But it's sort of an expected result.\nSince Berry's scarf has been gone for a long time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_21@If only Luna could help... Ehmew?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_22@Right! Why didn't Luna think of it earlier mew!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_23@Oh?! Does Luna have any nice idea?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_24@Luna can ask Whiskers and Tiger to sniff! After they remember the smell, they can spread the information to other cats to help meow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_25@Right! Luna is so smart to come up with this idea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_26@Great! This way, Berry is one more step closer to her scarf!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_27@You guys are helping me so much but I'm just being here doing nothing... Is it really okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_28@Berry, don't say something like that. Coach and Luna genuinely want you to be happy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_29@Okay... Thank you. I'll keep waiting for the good news then!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_30@Hehe~ Leave it to Luna meowah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_32@A few days have passed by. Just when I almost forget Luna is also helping us, she comes to me in a hurry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_33@Luna? What's so urgent?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_34@Well... We found the scarf, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_35@I follow Luna to the door and see a piece of dirty torn cloth lying on the shoe cabinet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_36@I can still see that it's the color Berry described, but after being ravaged outside for such a long time, apparently it can't be worn anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_37@It's better for Berry not to see this. Let's just say that we still didn't find it.\nThanks for your hard work, Luna.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_38@Just when I grab the scarf and am about to leave, I see the marker by the whiteboard floating in the air.\nIt looks like it's going to write something down, but then it gives up and lands back to where it used to be.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_40@It's too late to hide it from her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_41@Even though I can't see how Berry looks right now, I can feel the air becomes more upset than usual.\nI bet she must feel sad now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_42@Sorry, Berry. We've tried our best.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_44@The upset air faded within a second. To me, it looks like a girl running away crying.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_3_45@Even after apologizing to her, I don't feel better at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_01@After finding Berry's scarf, I still don't feel like my mission has been completed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_02@Because I know this is not what Berry wants.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_03@The tattered scarf is still on the shoe cabinet because everyone knows that we shouldn't touch it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_04@Sometimes I can see it floating in the air, turned around by some invisible forces, and landing back onto the shoe cabinet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_05@Whenever I see it happen, I'll walk towards the shoe cabinet and talk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_06@I believe no one wants this to happen.\nAlthough it's not cute and pretty like it used to be anymore, at least you can see it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_08@Berry didn't have the mood to write recently, so I can't really know how she feels after hearing my weak words of comfort.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_09@This is not good for the girl, but I don't have to superpower to recover objects...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_11@A good idea suddenly flashes into my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_13@Coach is asking me about... handicrafts...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_14@Yes. If it's available, I really hope Misako can teach me about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_15@Of course I can. However, I'll ask for some... tuition~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_16@A smile that looks a bit horrifying blooms on Misako's face as her fingers slowly dance on my crotch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_17@My husband is now on a business trip~ Is it clear enough for Coach~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_18@Uh, well... Yes. I got it... I promise...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_19@Since I can't think of any other person good at handicraft.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_20@Hehe, then that's the deal~\nPlease tell me what you want to make.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_21@Berry, just wait for me for a little longer and I'll give you an amazing surprise!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_23@After everything's ready, I leave a message on the whiteboard asking Berry to come to my office at a designated time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_24@Berry comes right on time. Right after the time I left on the whiteboard, I see a notebook flying into my office. It's then opened and says,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_25@Why is Mr. player asking me to come here? Did something happen?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_26@Here's the thing. I've got a present for you, but I'm worried that the other girls might say that I'm playing favorites. That's why I asked you to come.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_27@A present for me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_28@Yes. But I should give it to you somewhere more casual. Follow me."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_29@I bring Berry to my room and takes out the gift box I prepared in the drawer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_30@This is the present for you. Open it."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_31@After I put down the present, the air becomes silent for a few seconds. And the ribbons started to be untied by invisible hands which then opened the box.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_32@Th-This is...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_33@Inside the box lies a brand new pink scarf with white polka dots. And there's even something more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_34@Under Misako's instruction, I cut the tattered scarf, re-colored it, and crafted it into a pretty pin. It's now pinned on the new scarf.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_35@I thought you threw the scarf away and felt upset about it for a while...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_36@How would I ever throw it away? Since it's that important to you, it must be impossible to substitute it with a new one.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_37@So I decided to let it accompany you with a new look. This was really a tough decision for me~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_38@I smirk awkwardly looking at all the bandages on my hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_39@And here happens something I didn't expect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_40@I am hugged by an invisible force and almost fall down onto the ground because of it. After feeling the softness of a girl, I finally see what's holding me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_41@Thank you, Mr. player... I love it so much...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_42@Smooth purple hair, puppy eyes brimming with tears, and the familiar way to call me...\nEven though it's the first time to see her, I already know who she is.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_43@Are you... Berry?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_44@Eh? What?! Mr. player, you can see me?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_45@I can not only see you but hear you and touch you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_46@I put my hand on Berry's shoulder, which stupefies her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_47@Wow... What on earth is happening...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_48@If you don't know the reason either, then I suppose it's the so-called miracle.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_49@Do you remember what you were thinking when you hugged me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_50@Well... since you've always been nice to me... First, you worked hard on finding my scarf, then you hurt your hands making the pin for me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_51@So I felt a strong emotion which made me want to cry but happy at the same time.\nI didn't know how to thank you, so I could only hug you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_52@So since Berry's deeply touched, her gratitude towards me made her real?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_53@I'm a little surprised by how fast I can swallow all these and give them a reasonable explanation. I've really seen so many extraordinary things in my coach life.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_54@Anyway, I'm glad to meet you, Berry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_55@I didn't expect Mr. player to be the first one to touch me. I feel like dreaming now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_56@Ah~ This feels so real~\nIt's been such a long time since the last time I lean on someone's chest to hear the heartbeat~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_57@Berry starts to move nonstop on my body like a child.\nI can't help feeling some natural reaction happening in my body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_58@Then you should grasp this opportunity, since you don't know when you would turn back into an invisible ghost.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_59@Hehe~ Mr. player really cares the most about me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_60@Hey, Mr. player. Could you hold me for a while? I haven't been hugged for a long time either.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_61@Berry's cute and innocent look makes me feel like grasping this moment as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_62@Hold you? Sure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_63@I sit up so it's easier for me to hold Berry in my arms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_64@Haahh... It feels so good... Now I feel like being back to a human...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_65@Besides this, I still know a lot of things that only humans can do. Does Berry want to try them now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_4_66@Really? I'm dying to try them! Thank you, Mr. player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_1@When Berry is looking forward to the things that "can only be done by humans," I directly take off my shirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_10@So this is one of the things only humans can do!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_11@So this is how to make babies... But won't it be painful to connect a penis and a vagina?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_12@Well, at least I can promise you that all men feel good about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_13@Is that so... Aha! I got it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_14@Before I can ask what Berry realizes, she pounces at me onto the bed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_15@Since it's something that can make Mr. player feel good, I should try to help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_16@Berry says while holding my swollen cock and pointing it at her pussy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_17@Hm? Ahh...? Why can't I put it in?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_18@Seeing how confused Berry looks, I can't help laughing out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_19@Because you skipped this step! Normally you should do it first...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_2@Hm? Aren't you going to show me? Or does Mr. player wants to take a shower first?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_20@I gently hold my cock and draw circles on Berry's pussy with the tip of it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_21@How do you feel now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_22@It f-feels strange... But I don't hate it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_23@After teasing Berry for a while, I can feel some nectar dripping onto my glans from her slit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_24@That's right. Relax. You'll be able to put it in with this natural lubricant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_25@So, does Berry want to try again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_26@Berry nods and points my cock at her moisturized slit again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_27@As she slowly sits onto my body, my cock slides into her warm body inch by inch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_28@It feels special... So this is the so-called connection... Aah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_29@My cock seems to hit her sensitive spot whenever she slightly moves her body.\nHer bashful expression after moaning makes her look even cuter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_3@Who says I'm taking a shower? You can feel more with your exposed skin! Don't you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_30@It's Berry's first time, isn't it? We can stop at any time if you don't want to. I won't force you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_31@I, I can keep going! This is nothing compared to what Mr. player has done for me!\nSo Mr. player, just leave everything to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_32@Berry takes a deep breath and spends some time getting used to having a part of me in her body. Then she begins to move her hips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_33@Ah... Ahmm... Yahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_34@The squishy sound Berry makes, her moans and her pants, as well as the texture of her tight pussy wall... I'm enjoying everything she brings me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_35@Ahh... Mr. player... How do you like... this...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_36@Berry moves her face closer to mine than ever, looking forward to my answer with an innocent smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_37@Of course. It feels really good. Berry is doing a great job.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_38@Hehe... Being able to make Mr. player happy... makes me happy, too...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_39@Because of my encouragement, Berry starts to move even harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_4@Um... This makes sense. Then I'll take off my clothes, too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_40@Some minutes ago, Berry was merely a ghost I couldn't see or touch, but now, she's working hard on my body with her pussy tightly enveloping my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_41@Just by thinking about it, the impulse of possessing her grows even wilder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_42@If I don't make the most of this moment, it might become a pity in my life. \nThis thought refrains me from holding it back anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_43@My body twitches as my overbearing desire burst out with the white cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_44@Aaaaaaahh──!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_45@After the fierce exercise, I lie down to take a rest while Berry leans her body on mine panting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_46@Berry, are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_47@Pant... Making love with Mr. player... I like it... Ehehe...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_48@After saying the words with her remaining energy, Berry falls asleep right away. I can't help smirking at her cute sleeping look as I cover her body with a blanket.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_5@The naive Berry undresses her faster than I do. When she turns around, she sees me taking off my underwear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_6@Woah! What's that big rough thing down there on Mr. player? I don't have it on my body!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_7@As I expected, Berry doesn't have clear knowledge about sex even as an adult!\nThough Berry's words make me a bit embarrassed, I think it's more important to teach her a lesson now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_8@Well, this is called a penis, and only boys have penises. What you have is called a vagina, and only girls have them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h1_9@When a boy's penis is connected with a girl's vagina, it's called "making love." This is possible to make a girl pregnant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_10@Well...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_11@I've been thinking about what an ideal family will be like. And the constant imagination gradually becomes my dream.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_12@Hey, Mr. player. If you have a baby, are you going to take responsibility and take good care of him?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_13@Of course I am.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_14@That's the answer I expected! Even though I've never seen my parents, I still hope my child can have a happy family.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_15@So, Mr. player, let's make a baby!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_16@Huh?! Are you serious?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_17@Of course I am! Besides...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_18@I... can't forget the feeling of exercising with Mr. player before, so...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_19@Berry's hesitation in talking about our first experience and my agitating libido drive me to make the decision.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_2@I come to Berry's room to ask her out. But she's sitting by the bed, staring at the picture book on her thighs with a serious expression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_20@I got it. Berry, lie down first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_21@The obedient Berry lies down onto the bed waiting. And I lean down to take off her dress one piece after another.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_22@Not until her fair skin, perky breasts, and delicate nipples are fully shown in front of me do I realize how gorgeous Berry's body is.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_23@While Berry's cheeks become as red as a tomato because of being naked, her pussy starts to ooze out some glittering nectar.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_24@Berry is actually looking forward to this, right? How horny~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_25@I'm not ho-horny!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_26@Berry's refutation was so interesting that I lick the nectar around her slit mischievously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_27@Hold on, Mr. player... Ahahaha... It's tingly!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_28@After I'm satisfied with Berry's laughter, I finally let her even wetter pussy off the hook.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_29@It's about time. I bet Berry is ready too, aren't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_3@Berry, what are you reading?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_30@I say while taking off my pants and put my painfully hot cock into Berry's pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_31@Ah... Ahmm... Mr. player's rod... is still so hard and warm... It feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_32@Berry's embarrassed but infatuated look drives me to support her body up on me and directly strike my cock into the depth of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_33@Yaaaahh!\nThos feeling... I can't... Mr. player... If you keep moving like this... I'll...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_34@Instead of stopping me from moving, Berry's beg makes me thrust faster and harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_35@Berry, you said that you want to make a baby with me, didn't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_36@I, I... I did... Yahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_37@Then you'll have to work harder. We can't make a baby if you don't put the effort more than that when you're training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_38@Uuhm... Alright... I got it... Hahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_39@Even undergoing stimulation much more fierce than before, Berry still tries to sway her lower body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_4@I walked up to see the picture she's staring at. It's a picture of a family happily having dinner together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_40@I already can't distinguish whether the squishy sounds reverberating in my room are made by Berry or me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_41@This f-feeling... It's so hot... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_42@I can tell that Berry is gradually becoming absent-minded from her broken sentence and some transparent parts of her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_43@I peer at Berry's crotch and find that I can vaguely see how my cock penetrates inside her rhythmically.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_44@Such a novel experience just turns me on so much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_45@I'm cumming. Berry, make sure you catch all of my semen!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_46@Ahh... Mr... player... Don't worry... Just shoot it... all out...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_47@For our... happy family... please stuff my baby-making part with all your power!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_48@Hearing Berry's ecstatic moan for her climax, I shoot all my thick cum into Berry's womb.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_49@While Berry leans down against my shoulder, I can obviously tell that she weighs abnormally lighter.\nI reach out my hand to caress her long hair, finding that the string of her hair almost falls through from my grasp.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_5@Um, I'm sorry to bother you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_50@Berry, you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_51@Well... I know what Mr. player wants to say. But don't worry. I'll be good after a while.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_52@Look, if I really disappear, I won't be able to keep our baby. So why would I disappear? Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_53@Cuddling with the positive Berry, I start to picture and look forward to the future of being parents with Berry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_6@When I want to walk out to give Berry some personal space, she grips the corner of my shirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_7@Wait a second, Mr. player... Could you stay and talk with me for a while?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_8@Despite the confusion, I still nod and sit next to Berry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_h2_9@What happened? Berry can tell me anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_01@那天過後，小莓開始訓練自己在實體和幽靈之間自由切換的能力，而我也因為這份特別的能力邀她正式加入戰隊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_02@小莓開朗樂觀的個性讓她受到了女孩們的歡迎，但卻有個小問題存在。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_03@不，這應該是個不小的問題……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_04@教練，你有看見我的工業用鹽酸嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_05@沒有耶，正常來說妳的實驗室不是都鎖著嗎？會不會是妳放去別的地方忘記了？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_06@不可能，我每個東西的位置都規畫得好好的，所以一不見我馬上就會發現了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_07@真麻煩，重訂的話又要延長我的工時了，到底是誰幹的好事……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_08@我先幫你問問看其他人有沒有印象吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_09@雖然不抱希望，但我還是盡可能地去問每一個人。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_10@但是在問到小莓的時候，她說出了驚天話語。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_11@啊……那時候我很無聊，所以把大家的房間都逛了一下……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_12@然後在一張桌子上看到了五顏六色的果汁，好像很好喝的樣子，\n就把檸檬汁拿去喝掉了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_14@……不是吧？妳把工業用鹽酸當成檸檬汁？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_15@宮、宮夜用言酸是什麼？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_16@我瞬間感到頭痛了起來，把小莓抓進辦公室機會教育。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_17@首先，就算妳可以變成透明的來去自如，也不代表可以去亂逛大家的房間，那是侵犯隱私的行為。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_18@第二，不管妳知不知道鹽酸是什麼，請不要隨便亂吃亂喝。\n等等跟我去向理世道歉。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_19@真是的，如果妳現在還活著的話，喝那個就死定了啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_20@我、我知道了……對不起……因為之前從來沒有人這樣教我……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_21@不會吧……妳的父母也沒有嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_22@唔，我是在孤兒院長大的喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_23@院長阿姨雖然對我們很好，但她是個大忙人。\n老師也都只有教我們簡單的知識而已。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_24@其他的東西，我都只有在被人糾正過以後才知道什麼事情不該做，\n所以我後來一個人生活就常常做蠢事。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_25@有一天，我散步的路上剛好沒注意到圍巾有一邊捲到了樹枝上，接著跌了一大跤……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_26@然後我就死掉了～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_27@總覺得自己聽了一個很不得了的鬼故事……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_28@可能是因為沒有人認識我，也沒能幫我處理後事的關係，\n所以我一直沒辦法離開那棵樹太遠，直到你出現為止。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_29@聽到這裡我開始難過了起來，但是小莓的語氣卻輕鬆地像是在說別人的故事。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_30@那時候的妳一定很寂寞吧……\n聽到妳有這樣的過去，我很遺憾。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_31@欸？player先生不用露出那樣的表情喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_32@現在也因為有player先生的關係，讓我認識了好多好多朋友，\n所以我現在一點也不寂寞了喔！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_33@妳啊……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_1_34@我沒再多說什麼，只是大力地摟了摟這個我見過最傻也最樂天的孩子。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_01@「player先生！下禮拜有空嗎？我想要帶你去一個地方！」
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_02@因為小莓的邀請，我今天跟著她一起外出，搭上了前往偏鄉的電車。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_03@是要帶我去妳出生的地方嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_04@嚴格來說，是我成長的地方，就是我之前跟你提過的孤兒院。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_05@現在的我可以長時間變成實體，所以就有了想回去看看的念頭。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_06@當時我死掉的事情被媒體匿名處理了，也沒有大肆報導，\n所以阿姨他們應該都不知道才對。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_07@原來如此，我也很期待會看見什麼樣的地方呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_08@嘿嘿～你一定會喜歡的！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_10@雖然小莓很天兵也缺乏生活常識，但她找路卻意外地靠譜。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_11@在我們下車後，她很快就憑藉著自己的兒時記憶，將我帶到了孤兒院門前。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_12@店家都跟以前不太一樣了有點可惜，不過路是不會變的呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_13@走吧！我帶你去找院長阿姨。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_14@小莓熟門熟路地將我帶到了院長室，充滿朝氣地敲敲門。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_15@請問院長阿姨在嗎～？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_16@來了，哪位啊？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_17@應門的中年婦女在看見小莓後，露出了驚喜的笑容。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_18@哎呀，原來是小莓啊？長這麼大啦～\n好多年沒有見到妳了，還是跟以前一樣可愛呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_19@呵呵，是什麼讓妳終於想起我這個老人家的呀？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_20@阿姨才不是什麼老人家，對我來說您永遠都很年輕啦！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_21@嘴還是這麼甜呢～對了，旁邊的這位是？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_22@院長您好，我叫player，是水槍戰隊的教練，小莓目前也是我的隊員之一。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_23@水槍戰隊……哦，我好像有看過新聞，是現在很流行的體育競賽對吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_24@player先生對我超好的喔！教導我超多事情的！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_25@我也在宿舍認識很多新朋友，每天都過得很開心呢！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_26@啊啊，我想起來了，你是曾經有被採訪過的那位對吧？\n看起來是個很有前途的年輕人啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_27@知道小莓有你的培訓和照顧，真的讓我放心很多。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_28@院長您過獎了，也是因為有您，才能讓我遇見小莓這麼好的隊員。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_29@比賽可要好好加油啊，我會期待再看見你們的採訪轉播的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_31@跟院長暢談完，我跟小莓在孤兒院的後院稍作休息，\n不時看著在附近開心玩耍的小朋友。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_32@天空萬里無雲、微風徐徐，還有著自然的青草香，讓我也感到相當舒暢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_33@我果然最喜歡像這樣待在這裡曬太陽了！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_34@不只能回來孤兒院走走，還能再跟院長阿姨說話，還被她稱讚了……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_35@啊～想不到我還能夠做到這些我以為不可能再做到的事情，\n簡直幸福得像是要升天了一樣……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_36@喂喂！別真的升天了，撐住啊！\n妳在這麼多人面前消失不見我也會很難交代啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_37@啊哈哈，我是鬧你玩的啦，嚇到了吧～？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_38@是因為player先生，才能讓我有第二次「活著」的機會，所以我才不會隨便離開呢！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P032_N_2_39@為了報答你，還有能讓院長阿姨看見我上電視，我會在水槍戰隊裡繼續努力的！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_01@In the afternoon, I'm preparing complicated files for our team in the office as always.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_02@Suddenly, I hear the door of my office being knocked, and Saku's energetic voice comes after that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_03@Coach, may I come in?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_04@Come on in!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_05@Saku, is there anything I can help you with?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_06@Suku opens the door and gave me a big adorable smile that lights up my day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_07@Coach, I want to ask you for a favor~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_08@A friend of mine is coming to Star City for a vacation.\nIs it possible to let her stay in a spare room in our dorm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_09@Oh~ Sure. There are still a few spare rooms as I remember.\nYou can go to Nadeshiko for more details.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_10@Thank you, Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_11@Seeing how excited Saku looks makes me curious about that friend.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_12@It's my first time to see Saku so happy like that.\nWhat kind of person is the friend?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_13@Her name is Mizuki. We grew up together. She's my BFF~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_14@But she went to another city to be a firefighter, so it's been a long time since the last time I see her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_15@Saku seems really excited to meet her.\nI guess Mizuki must be a cute and kind girl just like Saku.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_16@The next day, I drive Saku to the train station to pick up Mizuki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_17@After entering the station, I see a girl with dainty short hair, Mizuki, waving to Saku.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_18@Meanwhile, Saku scampers excitedly towards the girl and hugged her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_19@Mizuki~ Long time no see~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_20@I slowly walk towards them when they're having a pleasant conversation.\nJust when I'm ready to introduce myself, I hear something that stupefies me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_21@Would this man be Saku's boyfriend?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_22@Huh? Eh! It's not like that!\nplayer is the coach of our water gun team. He has helped me with a lot of things...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_23@I guess so. Should this softie be your boyfriend... then I can only say your standard has become lower than the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_24@If I was drinking water, I must be splashing out some water from my mouth...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_25@What's wrong with this girl? What's wrong with her art of small talk?\nIf she really wants to criticize me, she should wait until I leave...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_26@And I'm not a softie but a toned coach of a sports team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_27@How could you say something like that~!\nCoach, I'm so sorry about that. Please don't take it personally. She is Mizuki~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_28@Normally, when being criticized right at my face, I should already get mad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_29@However, Mizuki looked so serious that she didn't look like she was taunting or something.\nSo I couldn't really get angry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_30@Well, hi. You can call me player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_31@Hi~ I thought Saku would have been dead of her dumbness somewhere on the street.\nBut now that I see her still alive and wasting the social resources, I feel relieved.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_32@All thanks to such a pushover like you, Saku the brainless single-celled organism hasn't been eliminated by the nature.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_33@Mizuki~~!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_34@And here they go again, fighting at each other playfully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_35@Though Mizuki is a little bit... different than what I imagined,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_36@she seems to be caring about Saku in a bizarre unique way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_37@Seeing how the toxic words that sound like bullying appear to be so natural between them, I guess they're really close to each other. I feel a little relieved now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_38@It's about noon. Let's have lunch first!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_39@As I put Mizuki's luggage into the trunk, the two girls sat in the back seat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_1_40@With shiny smiles like those, I guess the dorm will be more lively during these days of Mizuki's stay.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_01@It's been a few days since Mizuki came to our dorm.\nAt first, I was pretty worried about her because of her ways to talk...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_02@But then I think it should be okay since the kind lovely Saku is by her side.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_03@However, I'm way too naive...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_04@In the afternoon, I see Saku, Mizuki, Yui, and Kana in the living room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_05@This combination of girls attract my attention, so I stayed and watch them drinking afternoon tea together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_06@Hey~ How do you guys save money?\nI recently found that it's so hard to save money~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_07@Sometimes when I see super duper cute clothes or desserts that are soooo tasty, I would always give the clerks my credit card before I notice it, hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_08@Eh? Well, I don't usually eat outside because I prefer cooking my own meal.\nMaybe it will cost less on food this way?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_09@But recently I've been spending so much on buying ingredients...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_10@So everyone has the same problem~\nI've also been spending so much recently...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_11@Ah... So the cute girls are gathering together chatting on some adorable topics while having afternoon tea~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_12@Just by standing by the corner watching them, I feel soothed already...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_13@Don't you think you guys just totally deserve it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_14@Hm? Mizuki, you mean...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_15@None of the girls can react immediately to Mizuki's sharp words.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_16@Why are you whining about not saving money while having this expensive afternoon tea?\nDon't you think it's disgustingly fake?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_17@Mizuki looks so serious that it's hard to distinguish whether she is intended to taunt them or she is only analyzing the situation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_18@Mizuki! Hold on...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_19@Knowing that Mizuki is being Mizuki again, Saku wants to stop her, but seems it's already too late...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_20@Wha-What do you know about me!\nAfter a tiring work, of course I'll want to reward myself something!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_21@Guess this kind of unrestrained thought is the reason why you can't save money at all!\nNow I know you as someone who loves to make up excuses for yourself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_22@How about writing a newsletter for yourself?\nAnd the topic should be "Girl Idol Forced to Cut Her Expense for Personal Financial Crisis."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_23@This way, there might be some more donations from your fans!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_24@Then, Mizuki looks at Kana, who sits uneasily and is trying to comfort Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_25@And you, what's your excuse?\nWill you really go bankrupt buying ingredients?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_26@Or it's because you can't even read the numbers on the price tags in the supermarket?\nSo is your problem actually being too stupid?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_27@Sob... Mizuki... How could you say something like that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_28@Mizuki... Enough is enough!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_29@The living room suddenly becomes silent like a graveyard.\nI guess the yell from Saku, who always appears to be a gentle and friendly girl, has shocked everyone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_30@What? Did I say anything wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_31@Mizuki tilts her head, showing how confused she is.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_32@Mizuki is always like this...\nYou never listen to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_33@Now that the situation has become like this, I can't sit on my hands anymore...\nSo I ask them to enter my office one by one for some instruction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_34@And now it's Mizuki's turn. I want to talk about her problem.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_35@Mizuki, even though you're a guest in our dorm, I still hope you can try to behave...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_36@But I was giving them genuine advice!\nWhat I said was simple and correct!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_37@I know. But...\nNot everyone can take that kind of straightforward advice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_38@So sh-should I ask where everyone's buttons are before I talk to them so that I won't accidentally push them?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_39@I'm not asking you to do such things.\nBut at least you can try not to say something that sharp?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_40@After all, everyone wants their chitchats with others to be delightful...\nIf chitchats always end up becoming arguments, then this process of knowing one another through chatting will become meaningless. Don't you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_41@What's more, you would leave bad impressions on those who don't know you so well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_42@I understand everything you said! It's just...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_43@Mizuki is about to say something more, but she sighs instead.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_44@player... I actually come to Star City for a reason.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_45@I... am not here for a vacation because I want to have fun.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_46@Mizuki slowly tells the story about her critical interpersonal difficulties in her fire bureau due to her talking ways.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_47@Because of that, she was furloughed for a period of time.\nAnd her friend, Saku, suggested that she relax in Star City.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_2_48@This is the time I realize that even Mizuki is disappointed in herself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_01@In my office, Mizuki just told me that her interpersonal difficulties were affecting her career.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_02@A firefighter should be putting out fire or people, but I'm always igniting people's rage. And now I can only sit on the bench.\nI guess it's your first time to hear something like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_03@Mizuki stands disappointedly in front of me, looking like she was waiting for me to sanction her.\nAnd it's my first time to see her looking like this ever since I met her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_04@If you want... I might have some suggestions for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_05@Mizuki raises her head to look at me, waiting for my next sentence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_06@I can feel that you never intend to hurt anyone.\nBut when you're talking to others, maybe you can... stand in other people's shoes for a little bit?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_07@Since they are not Saku, they won't know that you mean no harm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_08@I... will try it.\nBut I'm not sure how well I can do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_09@Then maybe you can think in this way.\nThere are many things that might look simple, yet they usually can be seen from other angles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_10@For example, Yui works as an idol, so she usually has to spend her own money to buy her clothes on stage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_11@As for Kana, she actually makes lunchboxes for other members a lot.\nSo they actually have their own reasons.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_12@After listening to my words, Mizuki ponders.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_13@Oh, I'm not trying to give you a lecture here.\nI just think that the conversations might go smoother if you can see things from other people's points of view.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_14@Looking at Mizuki's upset expression, I suddenly think of an idea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_15@By the way, are you willing to teach us some lessons about fire safety?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_17@I feel that the girls aren't so aware of the importance of it.\nAnd it can also be a chance for you to practice your conversation skill.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_18@Of course, it's only if you have time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_19@Sure. I saw the extension cord in the living room fully plugged some days ago...\nAnd by that I confirmed that there was no person with common sense living in this dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_20@And if one day I see on the news that this dorm is on fire, I would also think you guys totally deserve this kind of consequence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_21@When it comes to her familiar field, Mizuki returns to her usual status in which she is so overly serious that she doesn't notice she's being mean.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_22@Then I'll thank you in advance... You can also practice by chatting with Saku or me more.\nSaku knows you a lot already, and I'm a pretty shameless person, so you don't have to worry about me being mad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_23@No problem! I won't hold anything back to you then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_24@Haha... Okay... And one more thing. Don't forget to patch things up with Saku!\nShe's already cooled off. Saku was just worried that you might be hated by other girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_25@Now that she's returned to the energetic Mizuki, I smile and remind her about Saku.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_3_26@Despite Mizuki's weird chatting logic, I can still sense that she has a considerate heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_01@In the following days, Mizuki gives lectures about fire safety from time to time
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_02@player... If these old wires get worn, you should buy new ones to substitute them!\nDo you really don't know the danger of worn wires?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_03@Mizuki points at the wire of the fan I'm trying to turn on with a shocked expression.\nShe looks so surprised that I feel like an idiot lacking common sense...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_04@I... Of course I know!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_05@And! You put inflammable things too close to the plugs!\nWhat? Are you trying to burn this dormitory and become an overnight millionaire with the insurance claim?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_06@Should this happen... I won't be a millionaire... I'll pay so much and become bankrupt instead...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_07@Oh, by the way. player, I think it's better for you to set a route for escape.\nIt would be very helpful when the dorm is on fire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_08@I'll try very hard to avoid burning this dormitory...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_09@This kind of conversation always happens between Mizuki and me every day. \nThough sometimes I don't know how I should react to her toxic words, I do know Mizuki is caring about me in her own way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_10@How have you been recently? I bet you're having better conversations with others.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_11@Yes~ Even though all the other people are stupider than Saku, I still tried my best to explain the knowledge about fire safety to them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_12@And... Saku helped me a lot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_13@With a lovely smile on her face, Mizuki tells me about the funny stories happening in her fire safety lectures.\nShe looks very happy as she finally takes off her cloak with mean spikes on it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_14@Haha... Very well...\nSpeaking of fire safety, can you be off for so long? When are you going back to your fire bureau?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_15@As soon as I finished the question, I could tell Mizuki suddenly looks very upset...\nDid I say anything wrong?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_16@Actually... I don't think I can go back in a short while.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_17@Huh?? Why?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_18@The sudden bombshell startles me badly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_19@Mizuki slowly explains while playing with the mug on the table.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_20@When I was furloughed, my fire bureau incidentally recruited a new squad of firefighters.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_21@So... I don't think they need me back anymore.\nAnd I already knew it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_22@Mizuki's disappointed expression drives me to rack my brain to find anything I can say to make her feel better.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_23@player, you don't have to comfort me or anything.\nBecause I guess whatever you say will be useless.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_24@I've already adjusted my attitude towards it.\nThis can be the time for me to take a rest and think about what to do next.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_25@Mizuki blooms her usual bright smile to me, but somehow I feel sad for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_26@We sit on the couch shoulder by shoulder and fall into a short silence.\nAlong with the laughter of the other girls from the outside of my office, an idea comes to my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_27@Mizuki, will you consider joining our water gun team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_28@Since you can't go back to your fire bureau now, why not try joining our team?\nSaku is also here, so you can take care of each other.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_29@I try to give Mizuki a nice invitation. Hope she can accept it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_30@But I don't want her to feel like I'm pitying her because I really want her in my team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_31@Hm? player? Are you so pathetic that you have to recruit any random person you meet? You know, I don't have any experience of this sport.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_32@Though Mizuki looks surprised, she doesn't look reluctant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_33@I was thinking that if Mizuki turned me down, I might have to ask Saku to convince her for me...\nBut I don't think I need that plan B anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_34@Haha... I do think you're suitable for our team, seeing how well you know about water!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_35@Mizuki is someone who will provide suggestions when seeing any problem, and she'll do her best to solve them as well.\nI can see that from her conversations with other girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_36@I bet if Mizuki is in our team, she can bring a different kind of stimulation to the girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_37@If you're worried because you don't have any experience, I'll teach you in person.\nAfter all, I'm the coach of the team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_38@Saku doesn't have any experience either, and now she's wrecking her opponents here and there on the court with her water gun!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_39@The image of Saku easily carrying the gigantic water gun that other girls couldn't even lift comes to my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_40@Alright. If player thinks I'm a suitable member, I'm in.\nNo matter how bad I am, I don't think I'll be worse than that stupid Saku.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_41@Huh? You're saying yes already...?\nDon't you want some more time to think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_42@Mizuki answered so fast that I'm pretty surprised.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_43@It's not like I'm selling my body to you anyway.\nJust consider me Saku's babysitter here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_44@Though I can't be a firefighter again now... I'll find something else I can do. I guess it'll be great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_45@Mizuki smiles again. I can feel how genuine her answer is.\nThis kind of positive attitude is also what I appreciate about her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_46@If this is the case, congratulations on getting a new job!\nThe first work for our newbie member is to clean my office...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_47@What~ There must not be such a rule! You're just too lazy to clean your own office, aren't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_48@Don't be such a pro! It's just your first day!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_49@When we laugh together, I see a new, wonderful hope showing from her happy smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_4_50@Despite the disappointment in the past, I guess we still have the future to look forward to, don't we?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_1@One afternoon, Saku came to Mizuki with a big smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_10@Haha... You're welcome...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_11@I didn't expect running a flower shop to be so tiring.\nI was already exhausted just by checking on the flowers, confirming the orders, and carrying the flowers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_12@These are really tiring works...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_13@While Mizuki twists her wrists and stretches her body, her curvy figure blooms in front of me.\nThe perky butt built with regular training slightly sways...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_14@I can't help walking towards Mizuki and putting my hand gently on her, moving between her butt and her back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_15@Well done for these two days.\nDo you want me to give you some refreshment?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_16@Oh...? I don't believe you have any good idea of that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_17@I walk closer to her, smelling the fragrance of desire letting out from Mizuki's body…\nAnd my hand starts to knead her butt to feel its bouncy texture.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_18@Mizuki slightly pants with her hands placed against the wall. She seems to be enjoying the way I massage her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_19@The other hand of my reaches to her breasts.\nAs I draw circles with my finger around her nipple and tease it, I can feel it getting hard even with her clothes on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_2@Mizuki~ I'm going to the flower exhibition for two days. I'll leave my flower shop for you these days!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_20@Meanwhile, her delicate butt is raised higher and higher along with my actions. It's the sweetest invitation ever...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_21@Ahh... player... lower... there...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_22@You mean here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_23@I slide my hand down the curve of her butt and reach it to the mysterious valley down there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_24@I can feel Mizuki's pussy getting moist as I caress it nonstop.\nIt's so wet that even her pants are stained.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_25@It feels pretty good... Umm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_26@You like it that much already? You'll love it even better now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_27@While continue massaging Mizuki's butt with one hand, I take off her pants with the other hand.\nThen, I let my both hands caress her breasts and private part.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_28@By the higher temperature I feel from her soft body, I know that Mizuki's desire has been ignited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_29@Mizuki is getting wet so soon. It's so hot and moist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_3@Two days?! Seriously? I won't be able to save you if you die of stupidness somewhere far away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_30@Between the raised bubble butt, I can see Mizuki's delicate pussy coated with crystal clear fluids.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_31@In response to her bashful but enjoying look, my cock becomes erect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_32@player... Is this the best you can do?\nI definitely overestimated youaaahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_33@No matter how aroused Mizuki is, she still wants to insult me with her mouth.\nSo I stop her with my action.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_34@I rub my rock-hard cock in between her butt, feeling the steam and sticky fluids coming out from Mizuki's slit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_35@You're so slow... Umyahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_36@Gripping her butt, I point my swollen cock at her nectar-streaming pussy and slowly insert it into her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_37@Though Mizuki seems to be enjoying the foreplay and shallow penetration of my burning cock, she still sways her waist unsatisfied.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_38@Don't rush... I'll feed your mouth down there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_39@On purpose, I slowly pull my cock out while enjoying Mizuki unconsciously swaying her butt because of her overbearing libido.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_4@I'll be fine~ Mizuki is caring about me so much as always~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_40@Ask for it if you want it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_41@Mizuki is so busy letting out horny moans and pants that she can't respond to me at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_42@She keeps swaying her waist, pushing her pussy towards my cock.\nMy cock feels like being devoured by her tight warm slit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_43@Haaahh... It's not enough... Umm~~ Your cock is so hot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_44@I grip Mizuki's waist unconsciously to suppress my desire to stick my cock to the depth all at once because I want her to beg me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_45@Hah... Tell me. What's not enough...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_46@Uuugh... Your cock is not... deep enough... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_47@As Mizuki sways her butt harder, her pussy also becomes hotter and wetter. It's as if it is screaming and asking my cock to stuff it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_48@Each time I pull out my cock, I can see it coated with crystal fluids. I can't help grabbing Mizuki's butt and starting my fierce penetration.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_49@My tough cock reaches deeply into Mizuki.\nAs I enjoy having my meat rod swallowed by her tight pussy, I brutally rub every inch of her tender skin in her secret garden.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_5@Sigh. How am I gonna do with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_50@Nectar starts dripping onto the floor in Saku's flower shop. \nFrom where I'm standing, I can see her pink pussy being ravaged by my cock and streaming out love juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_51@Hahh... I want more... I want it deeper...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_52@Having my cock tightly enveloped by Mizuki's moist hot pussy, I can feel the pleasure accumulating in both my body and mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_53@I brutally slap Mizuki's bubble butt. The filthy symphony of the slapping sound of meat and the squishy sound of love juices makes Mizuki even more aroused.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_54@So Mizuki is such a pervert... who does this kind of thing in her best friend's flower shop... Hahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_55@Mizuki's pussy keeps contracting and biting on my cock. The stimulation feels even stronger now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_56@I continue punching my cock into her pussy and try to ravage it into a nasty mess.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_57@I... I'm not!... You s-started it... Sob~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_58@Hahh... Your mouth down there is much more honest...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_59@With my full strength, I strike my cock hard into the depth of her pussy a few more times, forcing Mizuki to moan softly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_6@And Saku set out for the flower exhibition, leaving Mizuki in the flower shop selling flowers and tackling simple orders these two days.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_60@Along with my ferocious assault, Mizuki's breasts and butt keep jiggling and swaying.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_61@I, I haven't cummed yet... Umyahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_62@Still not saying uncle now...\nHahh... Your pussy is so tight...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_63@With Mizuki's love juices as a moisturizer, I can speed up my penetration.\nAnd the desire to conquer the unyielding Mizuki makes my cock even harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_64@While I thrust faster, I dig out more nectar splashing onto the floor or flowing down Mizuki's legs.\nNow, even her bouncy butt is fully stained by the sticky fluids.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_65@I try my best to hold my impulse to cum, since I want Mizuki to beg me to grant her my cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_66@Hahh... Tell me... Do you like it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_67@Sob... I li-like it... a lot~ Gimme now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_68@Mizuki sways her butt hard to coordinate with my moves.\nHer delicate pussy lips are now as cutely red as a tomato.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_69@I grip Mizuki's waist to mercilessly penetrate her horny pussy again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_7@As their coach, of course I have to care about this situation... because I'm afraid that Mizuki might ruin the flower shop.\nSo I come to help her close the shop in the evening.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_70@Mizuki screams as her body spasms. Now that I have full control of both her butt and pussy, her powerless look makes it impossible for me to hold it back anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_71@Haah... I'm cumming!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_72@I straighten my waist, letting out all the boiling white cum that is immediately absorbed by Mizuki's horny pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_73@My semen overflows from Mizuki's slit and drips onto the floor.\nAt the end of our sex, Mizuki's butt is already stained with her love juices and my cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_74@I leave my cock in Mizuki's pussy. Both of us gradually regain our composure from the afterglow of climax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_75@Pant... player...\nWe'll have to mop the floor again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_8@After cleaning and closing the shop, we sit inside for a short rest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h1_9@player, thank you so much for coming, though you were not helpful at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_01@One night, I'm categorizing some complicated files in my office.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_02@And suddenly somebody knocks on my door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_03@player~ I have to tell you a super important thing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_04@Mizuki's energetic voice comes to my ear from the outside of my office.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_05@Mizuki... Come on in...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_06@Usually, when Mizuki comes to me, she would be scolding me for forgetting to turn off the gas or the switch on the extension cord...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_07@Just as I expected, she is here to remind me that I forget to turn off the gas again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_08@player... I thought turning off the gas is as easy as turning your hand over, isn't it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_09@Well... I just forgot about it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_10@You forget to do it all the time. I'm having the feeling that you need some ginkgo for your brain.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_11@I'll remember to do it next time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_12@You had said the exact same thing last time but you still forgot to do it.\nIs your mouth the only functional organ on your body?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_13@I just can't help it. It's just too trivial for me to remember... though it is indeed an important thing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_14@But she just said that nothing except my mouth is working... How can I endure this kind of insult?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_15@How about you come here and experience... whether there is any other functional organ on me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_16@How to experience... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_17@I pull Mizuki towards me and sit her on my lap.\nHer body is leaning against me without any resistance. I can feel her soft warm butt slightly rubbing against my thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_18@This plump feeling... I can't help sighing in satisfaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_19@Mizuki, how about you remind me with your body?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_20@I reach my hands out for Mizuki's perfectly-shaped breasts and knead them to enjoy its comforting softness.\nFrom her neck I can smell the fragrance she just got from her shower.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_21@player... We're in your office...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_22@Hm? Anything wrong? An office is somewhere people talk about serious things.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_23@While caressing Mizuki's breasts, I can feel her nipples stiffen as if responding to my summon even when she still has her shirt on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_24@From her rare bashful look, it seems like Mizuki is not used to doing this kind of thing in the office.\nBut this turns me on even more and makes me desire more of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_25@So I slip my hands into her clothes and draw circles around her nipples with my fingers, while Mizuki unconsciously sways her butt a little bit due to my action.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_26@Ahh... There...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_27@With Mizuki leaning tightly on me and her butt rubbing against my thighs, my cock gradually gets erect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_28@Mizuki seems to feel the energetic bulge, for her cheeks become alluring red.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_29@After such a busy day... player is still so energetic...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_30@I'm the coach of a sports team, so of course I have incredible stamina.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_31@I take off Mizuki's clothes and let my hands wander throughout her flawless tender skin.\nHer trembling nipples are now rosy like blooming flowers waiting for someone to pick up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_32@I reach my hand forward to her lower body rubbing on my laps.\nAs I expect, her pussy is already wet in anticipation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_33@This wet already, huh? Then we don't have to worry about fire anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_34@What are you talking about... Ummm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_35@As I fondle her tender clitoris, more love juices flow out from her pussy and stain my pants.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_36@My cock can't wait for Mizuki's body lecture anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_37@As soon as I unbuckle my pants, my stiffened cock just burst out and reach between Mizuki's soaking wet crotch. The pleasant sensation of my cock being enveloped by her tightly-clipped thighs swells it even better.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_38@Meanwhile, I keep kneading her breasts so hard that my fingers feel like sinking into her soft meat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_39@Mizuki continues rubbing on my cock and coating it with her crystal nectar.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_40@Your cock... is so hot... and so hard...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_41@Mizuki, why not put out my fire with your pussy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_42@I lift Mizuki's butt up a little bit and slowly insert the tip of my cock into her tight slit.\nI want to enjoy her horny pussy to the best, so I try hard not to stick it right into the depth as I desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_43@Ahh... Deeper...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_44@Mizuki adjusts the angle of her butt and tries to sit down to make my cock deeper in her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_45@But I'm not letting her control my pace. I slowly push my cock into her to enjoy my cock exploring her narrow wet pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_46@Hahh... So wet and tight...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_47@Again, Mizuki tries to take initiative to sway her butt.\nI fix her waist to take control of her horny pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_48@player... don't you want me to put out your fire?...\nAaah... Hurry up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_49@I'm caressing Mizuki's breasts and slit while controlling her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_50@My slow penetration turns out to dig out even more nectar because of the desire for a fiercer intimacy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_51@Finally, I have my whole cock held in her pussy.\nMizuku's butt is sitting right on my crotch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_52@She can't help swaying her butt to ask for more pleasure from my cock.\nThe squishy sound of the sticky fluids makes Mizuki move even faster and harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_53@You've got so much water in your pussy...\nHahh... That's incredible...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_54@I keep stirring my hard cock in her pussy while her pussy sucks on my meat rod.\nThe wetness and tightness drive me to move harder as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_55@Along with the slapping sound of the meat and the lusty squishy sound, Mizuki raises her head and moans loudly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_56@I'm stuffed... Umyaaahh~ Gimme more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_57@I keep thrusting rhythmically and digging out splashing love juices.\nBoth Mizuki's butt and my crotch have become a wet mess.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_58@So wet and dirty... Ugh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_59@I mercilessly punch my cock into the depth all at once, forcing Mizuki to moan harder.\nAnd I pull it out to till my cock almost leaves her pussy, and strikes it to the depth again. After doing this a few times, Mizuki starts to beg me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_61@I penetrate hard into her again and feel her pussy start contracting.\nMore nectar gushes out and drips onto our thighs and the floor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_62@You cummed already? I haven't got enough here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_63@Wait! Ahh~ It's too much~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_64@I grip Mizuki's body and continue thrusting, ignoring that Mizuki is still sensitively spasming from her climax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_66@After the last sprint, I shoot out a huge load of thick cum and stuff Mizuki's pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_67@The cum that Mizuki can't handle slowly overflows from her slit onto her butt and thighs.\nLeaving my cock in her body, I pant with Mizuki to enjoy the afterglow of our sex.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_68@Hahh... Mizuki is really good at putting out my fire...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_69@Mizuki pants in satisfaction and smiles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_h2_70@This time... I did put out your fire...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_01@水紀加入戰隊後，每一次的練習都相當認真。\n她也很快地趕上了其他人的進度。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_02@重要的是，水紀似乎也越來越能融入其他女孩了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_03@雖然其他人有時候還是會被她虧幾句…\n但水紀的對話方式確實變得更圓融了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_04@我想這對她來說，也一定是一個全新的改變吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_05@這天午後，幾位女孩們閒著沒事聚集在大廳，似乎有什麼計畫…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_06@教練～來陪我們玩遊戲吧～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_07@欸？你們要玩什麼？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_08@我看著這熟悉的陣容：唯、咲與水紀、加奈。\n我開始好奇她們想玩什麼了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_09@我們來玩狼人殺吧！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_10@水紀這麼雀躍的樣子還真難得…反正我也閒著沒事就答應了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_11@因為人數不足，所以我們也只是簡單地改變了一下規則。\n照著我們自己的方式隨興地進行遊戲。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_12@遊戲開始後，由於不知道誰是狼人，所以大家都互相懷疑著。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_13@嗚～我死了～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_14@為什麼是殺我嘛～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_15@才剛開始沒多久，加奈就被狼人殺掉了。而矛頭意外地指向我…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_16@player…你是狼人吧！\n你的演技太差了，一下就被我識破了！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_17@我什麼都沒做啊……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_18@嗯！我也覺得教練是狼人！我投教練一票！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_19@不不、水紀你才是狼人吧！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_20@我看向還沒出聲的咲，期待她給出不一樣的意見。然而…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_21@教練一定是兇手！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_22@哈…我這也算是某種壓倒性的勝利吧……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_23@我出局之後，在場的就剩下唯、咲和水紀。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_24@欸，原來player不是狼人啊…也是，有這麼蠢的狼人嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_25@喂…我都出局了還虧我啊……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_26@女孩們你一言我一句笑得很開心。\n就算我出局了，在旁邊看著也感到氣氛融洽。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_27@遊戲裡只剩水紀、咲與唯。\n光看表情，還真是看不出誰才是狼人呀。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_28@不知為何，場面似乎開始緊張起來啦。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_29@我還是覺得水紀才是狼人。我相信自己看人的眼光！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_30@不過我才剛說完這句話，下一秒水紀就出局了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_31@player，這種打臉自己的話，還是不要說吧…感覺更蠢了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_32@真抱歉啊…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_33@場上就剩下兩個人了，這時候再玩也沒意義了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_34@狼人請自首吧！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_35@意外地狼人竟然是咲，實在掩飾得太好了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_36@難得咲沒有犯蠢啊～連我都被騙過去了！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_37@真是的…差點以為我要死了啊～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_38@我也有厲害的時候呀～嘿嘿～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_39@是是～咲偶爾還是很聰明的。偶爾而已。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_40@水紀怎麼這樣～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_41@我看著她們玩鬧在一起。\n想起了水紀初來乍到時，也是這個同樣的組合鬧得不愉快。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_42@現在卻時過境遷，彼此成為有默契的朋友和隊友了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_1_43@我想水紀臉上的笑容，應該就是最好的證明吧！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_01@一天下午，水紀興沖沖地跑來找我。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_02@player～你今晚有空嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_03@欸？有空啊。怎麼了？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_04@水紀的笑容似乎異於平常，特別開心。\n像是發生了什麼好事一樣。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_05@該不會是發票中大獎吧？？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_06@我超級好運的抽到電影票了，而且是兩張喔！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_07@原來只是電影票啊…\n你笑得讓我以為你發票中頭獎了……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_08@就是因為我發票從來沒中過，就算只中電影票也高興啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_09@那就恭喜你啦～\n該不會要找我一起去看吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_10@水紀手裡拿著兩張電影票，臉上表情突然有些害羞。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_11@…我只是想說這部電影感覺滿無聊的。\n找咲去看的話，咲感覺會睡死。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_12@所以這種苦還是給player承受吧。\n反正player你對電影的品味應該也沒那麼高端嘛。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_13@水紀講話總是要虧我兩句…雖然也早就習慣了啦。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_14@至少我知道她其實是想約我。對於這點我還挺高興的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_15@哈哈…好啊，那我就榮幸的答應囉！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_16@水紀忍不住綻放著可愛耀眼的笑容。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_17@夜晚到來。我們劃位後買了爆米花和飲料，提前進場。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_18@人還挺多的嘛，這電影這麼熱門啊？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_19@確實比我想像中的還多人呢。看來大家品味也都不怎麼好。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_20@噗——你講太大聲啦…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_21@我正在喝飲料，一聽水紀這樣說差點噴出來。\n我們旁邊可都有坐人啊！到時候被打怎麼辦？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_22@不過我發現水紀在講話的同時，似乎不斷地左右張望著。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_23@你在找什麼？有認識的人嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_24@我在觀察這裡的逃生路線和緊急出口的位置。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_25@欸欸？為什麼要觀察這個？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_26@我可不像player你毫無危機意識，在宿舍用完瓦斯都不關的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_27@在密閉空間，要好好觀察出口和逃生路線。\n這可是常識喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_29@但也沒這麼倒楣來看場電影就遇到火災吧？\n當然後面這句話我沒說出來就是了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_30@電影開始後，我們都沉浸在劇情裡。突然影廳裡似乎有種奇怪的氣味蔓延著。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_31@而水紀抓住了我的手，在我耳邊小聲地說著。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_32@player…你有聞到什麼味道嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_33@好像有欸……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_34@而此時人群也逐漸開始躁動了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_35@影廳裡響起自動警報聲。\n而那股氣味越來越濃——是煙的氣味！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_36@不是吧…火災嗎……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_37@也不知道是不是戲院工作人員還沒發現。\n居然還沒人來引導！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_38@我第一次遇到這種狀況…慌忙起身尋找綠色逃生指示燈。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_39@player，別慌。逃生出口在那邊，我們慢慢出去。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_40@水紀拉著我的手，堅定地安撫著我。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_41@大家別緊張，不要推擠！逃生出口就在右後方！小心腳下！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_42@水紀大聲地呼喊著，並打開了手機手電筒。\n她冷靜引領著大家出了影廳。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_43@所幸似乎並沒有真的釀成火災，虛驚一場。\n而工作人員們也適時地向觀眾們道歉與補償。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_44@呼…還好沒事，不然很可怕的啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_45@我看著鬆了一口氣的水紀，內心湧上一股複雜的感受。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_46@水紀…謝謝你…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_47@欸？有什麼好謝的？player你嚇到腦子壞了嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_48@哈…雖然不是真的火災，但我第一次遇到這樣的狀況。\n剛剛感覺自己都慌了…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_49@我想起剛才水紀有力地握住我的手，讓我安下心來的畫面。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_50@已經沒事啦～就說要看一下逃生路線嘛！等等我們去吃消夜吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P033_N_2_51@水紀笑著回答。我能感覺到她隱約的溫柔安撫，讓我也終於放下心了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_01@Tomoka overslept and missed the morning training today again, so I run upstairs and open the door of her room to scold her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_02@Tomoka! Are you going to skip the training afternoon as well?! Get up right no... Huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_03@As soon as I open the door, I'm stupefied by what I see.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_04@This room is extremely clean compared to Tomoka's room, which always looks like a landfill.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_05@What's more, instead of Tomoka sleeping in bed, I see a girl with double ponytails and rebellious outfit lying on the bed in a rude position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_06@As she stare at me fiercely, I feel too pressured to say anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_07@For a long while, the only sound that can be heard in the room is the presto loud music leaking out from her headphones.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_08@Hey! Are you looking for death coming into my room like this?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_09@Ah... I'm sorry. I must have opened the wrong door...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_10@After closing the door due to my natural reaction, I figure out what just happened doesn't make any sense.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_11@The sign on the door does say "Tomoka." So it means I was in the right room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_12@How would a girl I've never seen enter our dorm?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_13@And she called Tomoka's room hers?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_14@With my brain flooded with question marks, I knock the door again and hear the girl stalk to the door.\nShe opens the door and shouts,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_15@What now, dickhead? If you don't give me a nice reason for knocking my door, I'll let you swallow this bat!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_16@She holds the bat like a badass, which makes me even more nervous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_17@Well... Sorry to bother you but... who are you? Why are you in Tomoka's room?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_18@Tomoka? Who's that? I've never heard of this name.\nThis room belongs to me, Kamoto.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_19@If you want to live longer, stop knocking my door just because of this time-wasting trivia!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_20@Before I figure out anything, the door is slammed in front of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_21@Kamoto... Never heard of this name before.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_22@But her name doesn't help me explain why she's here and why Tomoka's gone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_23@I can't help frowning at this confusing incident.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_24@Coach, are you okay?\nI heard someone yelling here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_25@I turn around and see Akane looking at me worriedly.\nCan't believe I was so into that strange Kamoto that I didn't hear her coming.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_26@Akane... Sorry for making you worried. I'm fine, just a little confused at something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_27@I tell Akane about what just happened.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_28@Well... I don't have any idea now, but I guess the most important thing is to let her guard down, isn't it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_29@And I bet everyone who has just woken up needs warm, tasty breakfast.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_30@I'll bring Tomoka's portion of breakfast here.\nCoach, relax. You can leave the rest to me and go to work.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_31@Thank you so much, Akane.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_32@Don't mention it. I'm used to playing the peacemaker in the team after all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_1_33@Akane's help makes me much more relieved. I believe she can bring me closer to the truth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_01@I return to my office to wait for Akane's update about Kamoto.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_02@After around an hour, Akane comes to my office. Seems like they had a really long talk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_03@How was it? Was she tough on you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_04@No. After finding out it was me knocking the door, she looked more gentle.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_05@And that was why I confirmed that she really is "Tomoka."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_06@Huh?! What does that mean?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_07@Coach, check this photo out. I took a picture of Kamoto when she was focused on her music.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_08@Out of curiosity, I get closer to check on the photo.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_09@In the photo, the girl who called herself Kamoto was listening to the music with her eyes closed.\nHer relaxed facial expression looks just like Tomoka when she's sleeping.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_10@Before seeing this photo, I can't imagine they're the same person at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_11@Hairstyle, dressing style, facial expressions, personalities, and voice... with all these differences, Tomoka looks completely different now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_12@But... why did Tomoka suddenly become someone like this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_13@Coach, have you heard of "dissociative identity disorder?"
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_14@I think I have. Are you saying that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_15@Yes. I think "multiple personality" is what's happening on Tomoka. But we still need more observation on the reason why Kamoto is here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_16@Though Kamoto was willing to talk to me due to my close relationship with Tomoka, she still didn't say much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_17@What did you talk about?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_18@Her hobbies and favorite things. But I can sense her reluctance when answering my questions.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_19@However, there's one thing I can confirm. She really doesn't like you. So the reason of it my be the key to calling Tomoka back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_20@Got it. This doesn't sound like something I can achieve right away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_21@A worth-trying idea suddenly comes to my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_22@(30 minutes later)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_23@I've been waiting around the stairs for this moment. Kamoto is leaving her room for somewhere.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_24@Hold on. There's something I still have to talk to you about.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_25@You dickhead again? You're so annoying. Get out of my way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_26@It's my house, so I can stand anywhere I want.\nYou have no right to command me as long as you are living in that room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_27@Guuuhh... You shameless douchebag...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_28@Thanks for your compliment. Time is of the essence, so I'll make it short.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_29@I don't care whether you know who Tomoka is or not. But now that she's gone, I'm losing an important member of the team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_30@Since you've taken over her room, why not take over her position in my team as well before she comes back?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_31@Is this a threat? I don't buy it. And this is not somewhere I have to stay either.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_32@The rebellious girl looks away disdainfully and walks towards the gate.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_33@Is that so? How about free cool clothes, and the most famous rapper's CD with his signiture on it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_34@Kamoto stops. I can see the hesitation from her face.\nThanks for Akane's information, I'm closer to my mission target.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_35@Not interested? How about a VIP ticket to his concert?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_36@If our team make it to the championship, maybe he will come to watch our game in person...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_37@Alright, alright! Shut up already! I'll stay! Happy now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_38@Kamoto clenches her teeth. I guess she's trying not to show her excitement and anticipation in front of me.\nEnjoying my first victory, I smile in satisfaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_2_39@Deal.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_01@In a water gun competition──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_02@What do we do? We're going to lose this way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_03@Their defense is flawless. We're in big trouble...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_04@I can't stand you slowpokes anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_05@In this kind of situation, you have to make your own way! Get it? You gotta do it like this! Haaaaahh!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_07@Kana!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_08@Kana! Are you okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_09@What are you doing there? Follow my attack! Do you reaally know how to play the game?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_10@Look! They're fighting their own. It's our chance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_11@Eventually, we lose the game.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_12@(In the athlete lounge after the game)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_13@Kamoto, what on earth were you doing? Kana got hurt because of your reckless dash!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_14@I was making a chance for you to attack them! And you're not thanking me but blaming me?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_15@We lost because you wasted so much time checking on her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_17@I can't believe you're saying such disgusting things.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_18@Very well. From now on, I'm not attending any event with her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_19@Hold on... Rina!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_20@It's really your fault this time, Kamoto.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_21@Akane... Even you're talking to me like this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_22@We are a team, so we should think about how to win with our cooperation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_23@You were not fighting with us, but showing how selfish you were.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_24@Tomoka would never have done something like that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_26@You... you'll never understand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_27@Kamoto! Where are you going?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_28@(As I expected, there's no one who can really understand me.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_29@(Because none of you know how I'm here.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_30@(That day, I was wandering aimlessly at somewhere dark with nothing around, and I saw that little girl lying on the ground crying.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_31@Why... can't I do it... even after trying that hard...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_32@People would be upset if I don't do anything... but once I try to do something, I always fail...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_33@If I keep living like this, I'll only make Coach angrier and angrier...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_34@Who can help me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_35@(At that moment, I finally knew why I was there.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_36@Sup, lil bitch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_37@Hm? You are...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_38@If you really don't want to try that hard, you don't really have to. No one has the right to judge how long you want to sleep.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_39@Take a good rest. From now on, I'll help you fight against those guys.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_40@(That girl was always sacrificing herself to fit in the team, but you guys always took it for granted.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_41@(Therefore, I won't make the same mistake as hers. I'll only do what I want to do.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_3_42@(Even if no one understands me...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_01@pitter-patter──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_02@(It's raining...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_03@(Not like that girl who likes to stay home all day long, I prefer wandering outside.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_04@(So I'll just stay here alone, like how I used to be.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_05@(Huh? Umbrella...?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_06@If you get wet like this, you'll get a cold.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_08@Humph, you're even more annoying than I expected.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_09@I can't help it, since you're one of my members now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_10@Since you're here playing in substitution for Tomoka, then I can say I'm taking care of Tomoka when taking care of you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_12@You're actually protecting Tomoka. Am I right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_13@Ahh!! Shut up! Don't make such a meaningless guess!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_14@Looks like it's a bingo. According to my observation, whenever someone mentions Tomoka, you always have a bigger reaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_15@You told me you didn't know her only because you didn't want me to know where she was, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_17@Even if you're right, what do you want?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_18@I want to apologize.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_19@You...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_20@Before you appear, I didn't know that Tomoka was suffering so much that she wanted to hide at somewhere I couldn't find.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_21@But Tomoka is actually a really good girl.\nShe have not only relaxed other girls' moods, but also once comforted me when I was upset.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_22@She was never meaningless to be here. I hope you could tell her my thought when you meet her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_24@Do you know that Tomoka actually likes you a lot, you dickhead.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_25@Eh?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_26@Of course you don't know, because you're a heartless doofus. That's why she cares about your opinions so much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_27@I didn't know what's so good about someone who only scolds people and fucks people, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_28@Now I kind of know a little bit about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_29@I don't really know if I was complimented or not...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_30@Anyway, how about trying to get along with other girls after going back?\nNo one will know what you're thinking if you don't communicate with them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_31@They will definitely understand you after you explain it to them, especially those who are closer to Tomoka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_32@Hahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_33@I... I'll try it, maybe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_34@Does it mean you forgive me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_35@What a cocky guess, but it's not completely wrong.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_4_36@But should I find you pick up on Tomoka ever again, I'll beat you to death. Understand?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_17@Hey~ So Sis Kaka does care about Coach a lot as well~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_18@Who said so? Cut the bullshit!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_19@Whenever Sis Kaka wants to deny a truth, you always get mad~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_20@Well~ To thank Sis Kaka, I'll teach you something good~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_21@With a lazy smile, Tomoka reaches her hands into Kamoto's shirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_22@Lil bitch, what the fuck are you doing! Get your hands off me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_23@I'm doing Sis Kaka a favor~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_24@Now that we have the same feeling for Coach, I'm doing you good by teaching you this~ Come on~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_25@With one hand exploring into Kamoto's bra and starting to knead her breast, Tomoka unbuckles Kamoto's shorts and reaches the other hand into her underwear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_26@Damn it! I really don't want to fight with you, but if I don't do anything... Yahh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_27@Ah~ Looks like I just touched your sensitive zone. What a cute voice~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_28@Don't say something that embarrassing! Ughaah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_29@Oh? You're starting to get wet~~ Look, doesn't it feel good?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_30@Lil bitch... Shut up... Hahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_31@I'm losing my power to fight back... What the hell is going on with me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_32@Good job~ You're supposed to relax here~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_33@And no matter how weird you feel, you have to endure it. It's what Coach taught me~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_34@So... that douchebag taught you such nasty things?!...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_35@I must break his legs next time I see him... Hold on! What the fuck is that and where the fuck did you get it?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_36@Kamoto stares at the vibrator that suddenly appeared in Tomoka's hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_37@Sis Kaka, did you forget? We can conjure anything we want in this spiritual world~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_38@Though it's no match to Coach's meat rod, it should be enough for now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_39@I don't want to know how that bastard's crotch looks like at all! Yeehhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_40@While her body felt paralyzed being teased by Tomoka, Kamoto finds her panties pulled off by Tomoka within a blink.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_41@She can only lie there, watching the vibrator entering her pussy inch by inch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_42@What... This feeling of being stuffed is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_43@Wonderful, right? I know it before you say it, Sis Kaka~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_44@Are you readyyy~? I'm turning it on~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_45@Before Kamoto answers, Tomoka turns on the vibrator.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_46@Aaaahh!! Lil bitch!! Don't ask me if you don't want to wait for my answer!!! Haaaaahh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_47@Ignoring Kamoto's furious shout, Tomoka continues kneading her breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_48@Sis Kaka, well done~ That's right~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_49@Tomoka encourages Kamoto leisurely while fondling Kamoto's erect nipples and blowing gently at her ear from time to time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_50@Imagine~ You're now sitting on Coach and he's moving his waist nonstop. His rough hot cock is vibrating inside you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_51@Hahh... No... I'm not going to imagine that bastard inside me... Aah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_52@Coach is really good at it. He would keep hitting your most sensitive spot~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_53@No~ If you keep putting it deeper, I will...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_54@And he'll shoot out a hu~ge load of white and hot thing, stuffing your body~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_55@Shut the fuck uuuuuuuuuuuuuuup!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_56@Kamoto is finally pushed to the limit. She screams upon her climax and lies into Tomoka's arms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_58@Tomoka hugs panting Kamoto and pats her head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_59@Now we have another interest in common. I'm so happy about it~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_60@Then wish you a nice dream, Sis Kaka~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h1_61@Around the space that only belongs to the two of them reverberates the sound of the vibrator.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_01@Damn... That lil bitch set me up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_02@But what on earth was that feeling...? I just can't forget about it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_03@Don't tell me it's the so-called... addiction... If I could really do that with that guy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_04@... Tsk! Am I becoming weird because I'm living in this lil bitch's body?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_05@Now she should be controlling her body... huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_06@Sis Kaka~~ Help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_07@As soon as Kamoto hears Tomoka's scream, her consciousness is pulled out to control Tomoka's body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_09@Phew. It's finally done.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_10@In satisfaction, I look at Tomoka, who is now tied up on the bed.\nHer helplessness from the bondage makes her body looks even more tempting now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_11@To avoid her falling behind from other girls due to her laziness, I'll have to give her training from the hell.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_12@However, it's really impressive that Tomoka can still sleep so deeply in this posture.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_13@So I keep poking her plump butt with the new toy until her body moves a little bit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_14@Ugh... Where... am I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_15@I can distinguish this tone different from Tomoka's. As I expect, she starts to struggle hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_16@My arms and legs... I can't move... Hey! Somebody! Help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_17@It's Kamoto, huh? Just as I expected, Tomoka asked you to come and bear it for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_18@What the fuck did you do to her again?!... Let go of me!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_19@Do you really think I'll untie you after knowing you're Kamoto? I still want to live a longer life.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_20@What's more, even if it's a different personality, the training must go on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_21@If that's the case, I'll ask someone to help me! I'll make everyone know what an evil dick you are!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_22@Can you do that? I already thought you might come out and that's why I prepared this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_23@What is that foruuuuuugh... Guupghhuuuh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_24@When Kamoto opens her mouth to curse me, I fix her face and put the ball gag into her mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_25@Then, I immediately pull up the strap around her head to secure it in place.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_26@It's gonna end soon, so please behave until it finishes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_27@Huuphh... Uuughhum!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_28@Too bad. I can't understand what you're saying~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_29@That supercilious, mean Kamoto, is now fully under my control.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_30@This makes me even more excited than when I'm training Tomoka. And I can feel my cock more swollen than ever.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_31@Grabbing my meat rod, I gently rub it against Kamoto's pussy, which is completely exposed due to my bondage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_32@Uugh?! (This hot and bouncy texture... Would it be... that guy's cock?!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_33@Huumm... (So it's gonna be stuck into my body like last time... I can't wait...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_34@Ughh! (Damn! Why am I thinking about this kind of embarrassing thing!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_35@Soaking wet already. I didn't expect Kamoto to be such a horny girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_36@If you want it so bad, I'll stop beating around the bush.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_37@While caressing Kamoto's skin, I let my cock slide into her pussy smoothly with the help of her nectar.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_38@Uguuuuhmm... (It's in-inside... So big... so hot...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_39@(It's even wider than the vibrator... It feels so good... No wonder Tomoka likes it so much...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_40@Oh, you seem more relaxed and welcoming than I expected. What a horny slut.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_41@Kamoto frowns at my taunt but she can't control her crystal saliva overflowing from the ball gag.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_42@Seeing how embarrassing and helpless Kamoto is, I feel the ecstasy of conquest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_43@I'll tame this wild horse! This thought occurs to me, and I start a fierce thrust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_44@Guuhaaahhh... Wuuguhhuumm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_45@As I speed up, Kamoto's breasts start to sway ferociously while her moans go even madder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_46@Both your body and your moan are wonderful, Kamoto.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_47@(Why is this happening... I can't move or talk...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_48@(But because of this circumstance, I can feel the cock I've been desiring for a long time even better... So I don't hate it at all... Is it because I'm really a pervert?...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_49@From the love juices I keep digging out of Kamoto's pussy, I know I'm very close to my final counterattack.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_50@It's almost time. Come on, Kamoto! Let me hear your scream of climax!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_51@Ooougguuuuuaaaahh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_52@Along with Kamoto's ecstatic scream, I shoot out a whole load of cum into her pussy until it overflows from her slit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_53@I finally take off the ball gag from Kamoto's mouth. To tease her even more, I lick the cute silk of saliva between her lips and the ball gag.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_54@How was it? Do you like the training today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_55@I... li-like it... I want it... again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_h2_56@Looking at the absent-minded Kamoto, I can't help smirking in victory.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_01@Hello~ Can you hea~~~~r me~~~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_02@(I haven't heard it for a long time. The talking way that's so long and annoying...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_03@Ah, Sis Kaka, you finally noticed me~! Good morning~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_04@Lil bitch, why are you taking initiative to find me here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_05@Ehehe~ I'm satisfied with my long sleep, so I'm feeling bored and want to chat with Sis Kaka~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_06@Thanks to Sis Kaka, I was able to have such wonderful sleep.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_07@I know I can never thank you enough~~ Sis Kaka~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_08@Don't come so close! That's disgusting...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_09@But... after sleeping for so long, I feel like I can work hard again~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_10@So don't worry, Sis Kaka. I can take over and find Coach and other girls from now~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_11@Take... over?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_12@Ah, it doesn't mean I don't need Sis Kaka's help anymore~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_13@Maybe next time when I'm too tired to attend the training, I'll come back to Sis Kaka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_14@I know, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_16@(Tsk... After taking over this girl's personal life, maybe I'm also becoming abnormal...?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_17@再給我一點時間吧，我還有些事情需要處理一下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_18@好～～喔～～沒問題的，我還可以躺很久很久～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_19@那麼～整理房間的事情也就繼續交給小夏姐囉～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_20@唉，果然是個長不大的臭小鬼。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_21@（但，也正因為是這樣的妳，才讓我如此重視吧。）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_22@（隔天早晨……）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_23@啦啦啦～剛出爐的蛋糕～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_24@喂。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_25@啊，妳是上次的那個……請問有什麼事嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_26@這個，給我收下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_27@咦？CD？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_28@我不知道我除了這個以外還可以送妳什麼。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_29@不過就算妳不喜歡，拿去賣的二手價應該也可以……買點別的吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_30@抱歉，之前弄傷妳了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_31@沒關係的哦，妳的心意我收到了，謝謝妳！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_32@（當天下午……）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_33@那邊的，站住。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_34@是妳啊……有什麼事嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_35@呃，沒什麼啦，只是覺得應該來跟妳道個歉而已。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_37@妳這傢伙今天怎麼這麼反常？該不會在盤算著什麼吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_38@隨便妳怎麼想，反正我把想說的都說了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_40@對了，妳等一下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_41@幹嘛？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_42@有件事我想問很久了，妳的衣服都是在哪裡買的？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_43@我覺得還蠻好看的，所以也想買個幾件來展露我的魅力。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_44@還有，妳常聽的音樂我也想聽聽看，說不定能當成我編舞的靈感……之類的？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_46@（原本，我一直覺得主動道歉是件會讓我尷尬的事，所以總是很難說出口。）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_1_47@（但是在聽了那混蛋的道歉而跟著照做看看之後，\n才發現也沒有我想的那麼糟嘛。）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_01@最近總覺得夏若音也慢慢能融入女孩們了，這讓我覺得頗為欣慰。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_02@雖然自從那天之後，我跟她就沒再有過交談了，\n但我還是決定抽空找她聊聊近況。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_03@於是，我再度來到房門前敲了敲。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_04@夏若音，妳在裡面嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_06@沒有人回應，但我剛剛看玄關所有人的鞋子都在呀。她再怎麼樣都不會光著腳出門吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_07@基於擔心，我在做好被夏若音罵的心理準備後打開了房門。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_08@熟悉的身影還窩在棉被中熟睡著，在我關上門後，她又翻了一個身。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_09@唔……教練……？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_10@似乎是被我吵醒了，但是緩緩睜眼的少女再次和我預想的完全不同。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_11@早～～安～～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_12@夏……呃，燈歌……早安？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_13@教練～你是特地來叫我起床的嗎？辛苦了呢～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_14@燈歌雖然難得地看起來很有精神，但我關切的卻是另一件事。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_15@說來……之前很多人都見到了另一個妳……對這件事妳有什麼頭緒嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_16@我不確定燈歌對人格的事情知道多少，因此先裝做不知道真相。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_17@小夏姐嗎～？因為我睡飽了，她也說她的事情忙完了，所以她回去了哦～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_18@結果燈歌不只是知情，而且並沒有想隱瞞的樣子。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_19@對了，教練之前跟她說了我的好話這件事，她也有告訴我哦～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_20@我真的沒有想到會被教練稱讚呢，謝謝教練～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_21@她回去了……是嗎……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_22@我的生活看似恢復了正常，但是卻又像是少了什麼似的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_23@表面上總是很不客氣，卻用另類的方式體現著她的溫柔……那女孩真的已經不在了嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_24@我比自己所想像的還要更難接受這樣的事實，\n甚至內心已經開始渴求她能再次出現。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_25@那麼教練～你等我一下，我準備好以後就會下樓吃早餐囉～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_26@燈歌悠哉悠哉地下床，完全沒有注意腳邊，直接被一旁的小矮凳給絆了一下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_27@燈歌小心！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_28@我連忙上前接住燈歌，她也順勢摔在我的身上，我的胸口瞬間感受到大而柔軟的緊貼。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_29@剛剛真是好險啊，燈歌妳沒事吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_31@半晌沒有聽到燈歌回應，我疑惑地看向懷抱中的她。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_32@還沒看清就冷不防地被揍了一拳，跌到一旁之後我才看見那對充斥怒火的雙眼。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_33@真是好大的膽子啊，看來你真的很想被我打爛呢，混蛋東西。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_34@那個……我可以解釋……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_35@廢話少說，去死吧──！！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P034_N_2_36@看來，今後還有我受的呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_001@Somewhere in Star City, a string of faint light rains upon an empty narrow alley from the cloudless sunny sky.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_002@Along the light string, an unconscious girl slowly falls onto the cold ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_004@Uugh... Why did I fall asleep?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_005@After rubbing her eyes and stretching herself, the girl stands up and walks out of the alley in confusion and curiosity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_006@Whe-Where am I?!\n... Hold on. Why can't I recall anything? And my head hurts... so much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_007@Did I lose my memory again?\nWeird... Why did I just say "again"?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_008@Anyway, I have to leave here now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_009@Today I took Saki and Luna to a newly-opened dessert shop at the mall.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_010@The taiyaki there was so good meow~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_011@And the cake was awesome! Thank you, player~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_012@I'm glad you like it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_013@(I guess Kana has finished her cleaning at the dorm? These two girls are such a drag on with cleaning. That's the only reason why I'm babysitting them now!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_014@Ah! A park! Saki wants to play on the swing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_015@So does Luna!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_016@Alright, alright. Go ahead.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_017@Eh? There's a sick-looking sister on the swing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_018@I look at the swing and see an ill-looking girl sitting on the swing.\nHer condition worries me so much that I decide to walk up towards her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_019@Big sis, are you okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_020@Meeew! You're occupying the swing for too long!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_021@... Um, sorry! I-I'll leave right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_022@I knock on Luna's head and ask the girl to sit back onto the swing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_023@Ah! It hurts! player, what are you doing?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_024@You look sick. Please sit for a while more. Do you want us to take you to the hospital?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_025@It's okay. I'm already feeling better now. Thank you.\nNow that I take a nice look at these two girls, you girls are just so adorable!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_026@Regardless of her weak condition, the girl pounces at Saki and Luna, hugging them in her arms and rubbing her face against them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_027@Ah~~ You feel so soft and smell so good... And you even got a pair of ears! So cuuuuute~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_028@Uguuh! Big sis, you're hugging me too tightly!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_029@Muuuah! Luna can't breathe!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_030@Huhuu... This is fantastic... I... I can't...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_031@Ah... She fainted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_032@The girl wakes up in the dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_033@... Hm? Where am I now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_034@You're awake. Are you feeling better?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_035@I think... so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_036@I heard your belly roaring and that you're not feeling well, so I made some congee. I'll bring it here for you. Be right back!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_037@You're up? Hm... You look much better now. I'll walk you home after you finish the food.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_038@Thank you... \nBut I don't know where I live.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_039@Huh?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_040@I lost my memory, so... the only thing I remember now is my name Haley.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_041@Lost your me-memory?! Is it because you bumped your head when you fainted just now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_042@No. Actually... I just came to this world for a while. When I woke up in this world, I had already lost my memory.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_043@So that's what it is... Recently we have so many visitors from other worlds.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_045@It's not a big deal. Since you're homeless here, why don't you stay in our dorm for now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_046@Here's the congee! Be careful. It's hot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_048@Eh? Why are you crying?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_049@Oh no... Did I do anything wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_050@Thank you... But please stay away from me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_051@Haley leaves the harsh words, pushes us away, and runs out of the room.\nI didn't see this coming at all, so I'm stupefied for a few seconds before I can regain my composure and follow her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_052@Pant, pant... Akane, where's the girl?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_053@She just ran out of the dorm crying.\nCoach, is there anything wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_054@I'm not so sure, but her situation is pretty worrying. I should follow and go check on her. Please help me explain it to the other girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_1_055@No problem. Take care on your way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_001@I finally manage to find Haley and follow her to a beach near the dorm.\nShe sits on the sand and looks at a distant spot on the sea, pondering.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_002@... Haley?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_003@Eh?! Why are you here? I t-told you to stay away from me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_004@Well... As a man who has spent a long time with a bunch of girls, I can see when a girl doesn't mean what she says.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_005@I meant it!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_006@I really did... I don't want to bring you any more trouble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_007@But you lost your memory, didn't you? It would be hard for you to survive in this world.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_008@I'll fi-find a way out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_009@Sigh. In addition, your body is not in a good condition. That's too worrying.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_010@Well... I fainted not because of my physical condition.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_011@It's because of my... extremely strong empathy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_012@Strong... empathy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_013@To make it simple, I can strongly feel emotions and feelings from myself, other people, and even creatures.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_014@Though I've lost my memory, but from how I'm feeling now, I guess I'm feeling ill because this world is too different from my original world...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_015@Does it mean... our emotions make you sick so much that you fainted?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_016@Ah, it's not like that. It has nothing to do with humans here. I feel awful because I sense that the creatures here seem to be in pain.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_017@Well... it's maybe the doomed consequence of our high development.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_018@As for your emotions... instead of feeling ill, I accidentally cried because I felt too warm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_019@And I came to the beach because this kind of place makes me comfortable, ehehe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_020@So that's what it is. If so, you really should stay at our dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_021@But I haven't become able to control my empathy. I'm afraid that I might cause trouble to others.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_022@You don't have to worry about that at all. Everyone in the dorm is a good girl. What's more, I'll feel bad to ditch you after knowing your story!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_023@Ahaha, sorry about that. I couldn't help venting all my thoughts because you're a warm person...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_024@Anyway, no excuse will be accepted! Come on. Let's go back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_025@Sob... Alright. Thank you, really!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_026@After I finally persuaded Haley to go back to the dorm with me, we're walking shoulder by shoulder on the street. Out of the blue, she stops with a long face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_028@There's an evil intention... near us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_029@Wha-What?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_030@(Should it be that my nasty thought is sensed by her?!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_031@There!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_032@Haley swiftly dashes into a dim alley. After a few seconds, I hear a man screaming.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_033@Ha-Haley?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_034@Haley angrily drags out an unconscious man out of the alley and throws his gun onto the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_035@Humph... Looks like he was planning to rob someone. As I expected... the evils are everywhere.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_036@Hm? Why am I saying so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_037@Gosh! It's a gun!!\nLet's send him to the police station!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_038@No problem. But what is a police station...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_039@It's... a place with a squad of people who protect the city... I suppose?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_040@So it means a justice-executing knight squad. Understood.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_041@Haley then picks up the man with a single arm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_042@Oh? Pretending to be unconscious? What a clever move. But... it doesn't work on me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_043@Da-Damn! How dare you bitch look down on me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_044@The man frees himself from Haley's grip and tries to punch her. Just when I'm about to stop him, I see her dodge all the attacks easily and even knock him down with a counterattack.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_045@You're the one underestimating me. Without some actual power, how am I supposed to conquer the evils?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_046@Alright. Let's take him to the knights.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_047@Policemen!...\nBut I have to ask... why are you so good at fighting as someone who can't recall anything?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_048@Ehehe, I guess it's the so-called "muscle memory"?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_049@(Nimble movement, battle skills, and that curvy shape... I would be stupid not to invite her to join the team!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_050@Haley, would you be worried if you stay in our dorm and eat our food without paying anything back to us?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_051@O-Of course!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_052@If so, try the water gun competition! Actually, where we live is a dorm for our team members.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_053@As long as you become one of the members, everything will make perfect sense!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_2_054@Eh?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_001@Hahh! Eat my light spear! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_002@Holy light! Grant me power!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_003@Wow~~ Haley's performance is more than impressive!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_004@Big sis is super strong! Let me call you sensei!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_005@But... why are you shouting something like skill names while battling?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_006@Well... I don't know either. They just slip out from my lips... Ahaha...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_007@I don't see anything wrong with that. It makes her look much cooler and more powerful!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_008@(Just as I thought, she is perfect for our team...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_009@Anyway, thank you guys... I... Ugh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_010@Ah, Haley fainted again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_012@Sorry... I did it again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_013@You don't have to apologize. You're not intended.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_014@Is someone like me... really suitable for the team...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_015@You're worrying too much. Everyone was asking me to invite you to the team before I even asked them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_016@I-Is that so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_017@Of course. Don't you have strong empathy? I think you can sense that I'm not lying.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_018@... Thank you... Sob, sob...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_019@What a crybaby. You may call me Coach from now on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_020@Understood! However... besides sincerity, I also sensed some evil intention on Coach. Why is that...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_021@(C-Crap! Haley in a swimsuit looks way too sexy. I just can't help it...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_022@Since you're not good at controlling your empathy now, I guess sometimes it would still go wrong, hahaha!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_023@So that's what it is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_024@If you're worrying so much about your empathy, why don't you let me train with you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_026@Now that the tournament has finished, I have more spare time. Furthermore, this is for our team's good, so please don't say no.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_027@Al-Alright. Then I'll trouble Coach. Please train me well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_028@Ah! I still don't know Coach's name!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_029@It's player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_030@player... Got it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_031@At night, I really can't fall asleep, so I go to the living room to analyze some reports of the team.\nSuddenly, a cup of warm milk appears in front of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_032@... Coach, are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_033@Ah, don't worry. I'm fine. Sorry for making you worried.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_034@I suppose it's really too overbearing for both your body and mind to manage and train the team while practicing controlling empathy with me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_035@I'll get mad if you say anything like you want to leave because you think you're causing too much trouble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_036@Woah! Can Coach read my mind?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_037@It's because you always have your mind written on your face!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_038@Frankly speaking, I don't think your empathy is trouble to others. Instead, it helps people.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_040@I know everything. Whenever you sense any other member doesn't feel good, you would ask for a rest, saying you're feeling ill because of your empathy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_041@And when I'm exhausted both physically and mentally, you would come to give me some care, as well as a cup of warm milk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_042@These are things that only you can do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_044@What's more, when I first met you, you prevented a robbery with your empathy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_045@Therefore, don't you ever consider yourself, or your special ability, as trouble. Do you understand me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_046@... I do. I'll... work for that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_047@Thank you, player... With such warm words like that, I can feel myself stop hating me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_048@With her eyes brimming with tears, Haley blooms a warm smile. I pat her head and take a sip of the warm milk she gave me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_049@After a few weeks, Nadeshiko enters my office with a worrying expression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_050@Coach, there's something you might need to deal with.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_051@What's wrong? Why are you having a long face?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_3_052@The financial management of the team goes a little bit wrong because of Haley...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_001@Wow~! Big sis, how did you know I want this new doll?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_002@Ehehe, because I have a superpower! Do you like it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_003@I love it!! Thank you~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_004@Haley, the kitchen utensils you gave me last time are very useful! I have to thank you too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_005@Uhmm~ The new pillow is so soft~ It feels good~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_006@I didn't expect to get the coolest R-brand stereo system! Haley! I love you!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_007@Haha, don't mention it. This is what I should do for you guys!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_009@(I was just wondering why the atmosphere of the team has become so good and why some girls asked me if Haley is a rich girl. So this is the real story...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_010@Haley, could you come to my office with me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_011@Hm? Sure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_012@I heard that you go out window shopping a lot with other girls recently?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_013@Yes! This is how I know what others want!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_014@I can not only observe their desire from their released feelings when they look at the products, but also ask them what others like. This is the most efficient way I can think of!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_015@Well... I got it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_016@Hmmm... Then... where did you get the money to buy those gifts for the girls?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_017@I got it from Sis Nadeshiko! Other members told me that if the team needs anything, I should ask her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_018@... Haley... This gift thing can't work like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_019@Eh? What does that mean?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_020@You can't buy whatever the members want with the team's budget.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_021@Wh-Why is that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_022@Well... Because we have a limited budget but endless desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_023@Though I'm really happy about the better atmosphere in the team, if you continue buying gifts like this, we're going to go bankrupt soon!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_024@And... you're not in your best condition in the training recently, are you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_025@... No. It's because I'm overusing my empathy power recently...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_026@Sigh. I knew it. I understand how you want to make the team better, but you have to do it in the right way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_027@If you don't stop this, you'll not only get sick but also trouble others.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_029@I, I got it... Sorry... I'll never do it again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_030@After apologizing, Haley leaves my office immediately. This is when I find a finely-wrapped gift on my chair.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_031@I then open the box and see the game I've been saying that I want it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_032@(Was I... too harsh?)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_033@After our conversation in the office, Haley still shows up at the training, but most of the time she's not in the dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_034@Even without strong empathy like Haley's I can sense that she's not in a very good condition. Maybe I really need to talk to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_035@... Sigh.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_036@You really are here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_037@Ah! Coach! Why are you...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_038@It's really easy to read your mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_039@Are you complimenting me... or dissing me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_040@I don't see you in the dorm so often. Is there anything wrong? Is it because of our last conversation?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_041@No! It's not! Coach has nothing to do with it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_042@I'm just... thinking about the right way to help our team...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_043@Well... Have you got an answer then?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_044@Not yet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_045@Then you should find somebody to talk to about it.\nFrom my point of view, you're doing well already. It's just that you're not that familiar with this world now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_047@Besides, you're only trapping yourself by carrying all the burden on your shoulders. I believe all the girls are willing to listen to you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_048@... Hmm... Do you mean... I'm causing even more trouble by leaving everything to myself because I don't want to cause any trouble?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_049@That's right. But it's only my opinion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_050@I hope you can become more willing to let other people help you. It's also important to show other people that you need them. Take myself for example. I need you a lot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_052@Therefore, I really hope you can trouble me more, so that I can know you need me as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_053@I got it...! I'll try my best to trouble you! player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_054@You don't really need to try your best... Just some effort would be fine. I'm kinda afraid of your best trying now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_055@Ehehe, got it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_056@I was really too harsh on you last time, and I'm sorry about that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_057@No. It was my fault that I didn't ask you and others before deciding something wrong, so I'm the one to say sorry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_4_058@Haley and I smile at each other, looking at the sea glittering beneath the sun.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_001@Today, Haley invited me to a suburban beach with her. As soon as we drive to the spot and get off the car, Haley hugs my arm and drags me forward.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_002@Alright! It's our relaxing trip!! Let's head to the spot with the best scenery!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_003@Huh? Hey! Slow down!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_004@Haley lets out her tongue playfully and gives me an adorable smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_005@Surrounded by her arms, my arm is pressed tightly against her side boob. I can't help swallowing over the soft texture.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_006@After a short while, we pass a bunch of coconut trees and arrive at the beach. Maybe because it's a weekday, we don't see anyone around.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_007@player, look! The color of the sea and the scenery are so great from here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_008@... Right. It's really gorgeous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_009@Terrific! I'm glad you like it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_010@Actually, I was talking about you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_011@Haley blushes and turns her head to the other side bashfully after seeing my evil smirk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_012@You're jo-joking around again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_013@Oh right, in this world, if you don't apply sunscreen on your body, your skin will get burned by the sun. I happen to bring it with me. Why don't you let me help you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_014@Is that so? Then I'll trouble player for a while.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_015@I squeeze some cool sunscreen on my palms and gently touch her fair and delicate shoulders and arms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_016@Haley trembles a little. I can see her face turn as red as a tomato and some goosebumps on her arms.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_017@What's wrong? Is it too cold?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_018@I-It's not!... Please continue, player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_019@After finishing with her arms, my hands start to wander around Haley's neck and exposed back. From her faint moan, I know that I might have touched her sensitive spot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_020@Then I begin to caress her slender waist back and forth and knead her bouncy butt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_021@As Haley lets out short and weak moans, her skin turns hotter and hotter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_022@You're so sensitive.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_023@I can't help it... My empathy power... is mixing our feelings together in my body...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_024@It's pretty satisfying to see Haley moaning nonstop with only my caress. I then slide my fingers to the inside of her crotch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_025@Yahh! Not... not there. It's too sensitive there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_026@But you'll have to get everywhere applied. It hurts when you get sunburned.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_027@I keep rubbing my fingers against Haley's thighs while fondling her slit, which is tightly covered by her bikini bottom.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_028@She starts to pant harder, with her legs trembling slightly and her bikini bottoms wetting because of her secreted nectar.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_029@Seeing her half-closed eyes of ecstasy, I reach out my hands to her plump breasts to knead them while teasing her erect nipples.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_030@Ha... Hahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_031@Well, it's a little bit hard to continue applying this way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_032@Haley leans against my chest powerlessly. After lifting her hot body up and putting her down against a coconut tree nearby, I pull up her bikini and take off her bikini bottoms and my swim trunks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_033@My rock-hard cock bursts out, showing off its veiny excitement that catches Haley's misty eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_034@This... this is...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_035@This is what makes you even more comfortable.\nFeel it well with your body and empathy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_036@I lift Haley's foot up and rub my cock against her moist hot slit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_037@Ahh... What's this feeling? It's so strange... but wonderful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_038@Soon, I can feel my meat rod enveloped by her soft pussy lips and coated with streaming nectar.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_039@Even without any memory, you look surprisingly experienced in this. Is this also the "so-called muscle memory"?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_040@It's no-not...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_041@Before Haley could finish her answer, my cock already slide in her warm pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_042@Aaaah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_043@While fondling Haley's delicate nipples, I stir my cock inside her soaking wet pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_044@Hah... Uhmm... Haah... Ughmm...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_045@I planned to play with Haley's body for more, but I just can't resist the temptation from her. So I decided to straighten my waist and start thrusting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_046@Hahh... It's so... good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_047@With her eyes brimming with tears and her mouth opening wider because of the nonstop moans, Haley keeps leaking out nectar flowing down along her legs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_048@After thrusting for a while, I slowly push my cock into the depth of her, and pull it out, repeating it as if I'm playing around.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_049@Ahh!! No... Ahh... Uhmm... If you move like this... Umyaaahh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_050@The aroused Haley arches her waist and takes the initiative to sway it, making the penetration even faster.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_051@... What a horny body.\nIs it the most you can handle? Don't tell me you think this is the best I can do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_052@I lean closer to Haley and speed up my penetration. The lewd squishy sound keeps coming out from where our bodies are interlocked.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_053@Umyaah... No way... Ugmmm... Yaaah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_054@While Haley's tremendous breasts jiggle up and down along with my penetration, the smell of the sea and Haley's fragrance keep stimulating my nose.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_055@The rhythmical and nasty squishy sound reverberates around the coconut forest as Haley looks glittering beneath the sun with her tears and sweat decorating her fair body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_056@Umyaaaahh!! I feel too hot... to think about anything...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_057@Haley trembles while her pussy contracts and bites on my cock as if she desires even more of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_058@The pleasant sensation immediately strikes my body. I can't help penetrating harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_059@Gahh... I'm cumming!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_060@The comfy and numbing feeling of my cock enveloped and sucked by Haley's pussy is so good for me that I can't hold my urge to cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_061@Yaaahh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_062@Mixed with Haley's love juice, my white cum overflows from her slit and stains her hot skin.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_063@Ahh... Uhmm... This feels... weird...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_064@Haley pants and lies powerlessly on the beach, letting our fluids drip onto the wet sand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_065@How does it feel?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_066@I've never experienced... this kind of nice feeling...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_067@So, do you like it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h1_068@... Yes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_001@Since our team won the tournament, I took the girls here to a famous camping spot to celebrate and relax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_002@Haah~~ Barbeque was awesome!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_003@Meat has recovered my consumed magic power!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_004@Hehe, now that we're full, why not go play with water by the river?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_006@Have fun, girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_007@Watching the gorgeous scene of the girls playing in the river, I feel healed mentally and physically.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_008@However, I don't see Haley playing with them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_009@Akane, have you seen Haley?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_010@During the barbeque, she said she wanted to find somewhere to rest and left.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_011@Got it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_012@Coach, are you looking for her? Do you need my help?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_013@It's okay. I'll go find her. Have fun with the other girls, Akane.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_014@According to my understanding of Haley, I climb up along the river and find Haley lying on a piece of tarpaulin resting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_015@Why are you lying here alone?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_016@Ah, it's player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_017@Because there are fewer people here. It's better for me to feel for the creatures of great nature. It feels really great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_018@Haley reaches out her arms under her head and stretches her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_019@Due to her full stretch, the tiny piece of bikini covering her breasts is squeezed, showing a little bit of her pink areola.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_020@I can't help smirking at Haley, whose bikini seems to be failing to cover anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_021@You should really learn how to wear your clothes properly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_022@I slide my hands into her bikini, pretending to help Haley pull it up. But I'm actually rubbing my fingers against her nipples.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_023@Woah, I can't pull it up. Is it because your bikini is too small?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_025@I can feel Haley's nipple erecting under my caress, as well as my cock swelling because of her faint moans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_026@No. I really can't pull it up. So I have no choice but to...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_027@I pull down Haley's top all at once, releasing her plump pair of breasts, seeing the tempting rosy pink on both her cheeks and her nipples.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_028@player! Wha-What are you doing?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_029@Making you more comfortable of course. After all, the main purpose of this trip is to relax you girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_030@I sit up to tease her nipple with one hand while untying her bikini bottom to caress her clitoris with the other hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_031@Soon, Haley's private part begins to swell and secrete crystal love juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_033@Judging by how sensitive you are, I can see you didn't lie to us about your extreme empathy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_034@I take off my swimming trunks and rub my tough cock against Haley's warm slit gently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_035@With misty eyes, Haley straightens her waist in response, enveloping my cock with her delicate pussy lips. The nectar of excitement keeps dripping onto the tarpaulin.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_036@Haley's body is really horny...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_037@S-Stop mocking me already and put it in...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_038@Gripping Haley's tender thighs, I point my cock at her slit and immediately stick it into the depth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_039@Ah... Ah!! So deep...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_040@A pleasant warmth soon runs all over my body as Haley's moist warm pussy lips envelopes my cock tightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_041@Just when I'm still enjoying it, Haley takes initiative to sway her waist and have my cock thrusting inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_042@... It's so good... Ughmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_043@Hehe, you want it so bad?\nI can do it better for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_044@I straighten my waist to speed up the penetration, making the azure accessories on Haley's waist tinkle nonstop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_045@The nasty sound of meat keeps coming out as my crotch bump onto Haley's bouncy butt and legs each time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_046@Ughmmm... Umyaaaahh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_047@As Haley's moan goes louder, she starts to tremble and her pussy begins to contract.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_048@Every time I punch my cock into Haley, I can feel it being tightly bitten by her narrow soaking wet pussy. The pleasant sensation makes me speed up my penetration and digs out even more love juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_049@Hmmm... Ahh... So hot... I... can't... anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_050@The nasty meat sound and squishy sound reverberate together into a lewd harmony.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_051@Haley almost cries out, with her giant breasts swaying ferociously and her slender waist and thighs stained with her splashed fluids and sweat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_052@With the numbing sensation down there and the seductive scene in front of me, I can't hold back the urge to cum anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_053@Aaaaahh! Don't!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_054@I shoot the sticky load of cum into her pussy all at once and see it overflow from her slit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_055@With her thighs stained with my cum, Haley squints her eyes and pants, giving me an alluring smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_056@If we keep doing this... I might be addicted to it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_057@Well then, I'll satisfy your addiction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_h2_058@I lower my head to kiss Haley's soft lips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_001@今天，在海莉格的提議下，我帶著大家一起到海邊遊玩。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_002@呀！等等、先別潑啊！人家還沒適應海水的溫度啦！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_003@哈哈哈－－！妳以為這樣就結束了嗎？！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_004@住、快住手！好冰、好冰！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_005@唉呀，好久沒有像這樣放鬆了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_006@姆嗚～太陽～好舒服啊～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_007@……呼嗚～大家晚安～～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_008@呵呵，看來大家都很開心。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_009@是呀，難得來到海邊不是訓練而是放鬆。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_010@這都是多虧了海莉格的提議呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_011@欸嘿嘿嘿、大家開心，我也開心！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_012@那我也去跟大家一起玩水啦。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_013@對了、海莉格，太陽很大，妳有沒有塗防曬？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_014@塗防曬？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_015@啊、因為在這個世界，不塗防曬乳的話，太陽會傷害皮膚的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_016@剛好我這裡有一罐，妳躺下來，我幫妳塗吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_017@當我沾滿防曬乳的手觸碰到海莉格肌膚的那一剎那，她的身體突然用力地抖了一下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_018@怎麼了？是防曬乳太冰了嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_019@沒、沒什麼，教練你繼續吧！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_020@我塗抹的時間越長，海莉格的表情就變得越奇怪，彷彿是在隱忍著什麼似的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_021@好，塗完啦！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_022@……那我也去玩了！教練再見！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_023@我還來不及回應，海莉格就快速地跑走了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_024@之後，我也開始一起和大家玩，但奇怪的是，只要我出現，海莉格就會跑去別的地方，彷彿在避開我似的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_025@教練！來玩沙灘排球吧－－！我們這隊少一個。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_026@好呀，我暖身一下……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_027@那個、我打得有點累了，我先去旁邊休息唷。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_028@欸欸？！海莉格？！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_029@（果然……是在躲我吧？）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_030@那天之後，海莉格還是一樣，只要見到我就會特意避開。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_031@為了改善這種不妙的情況，我在訓練賽後，以要挑選送給女性的禮物為由，硬拉著海莉格出門。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_032@教、教練……你找其他人也可以的！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_033@嘖嘖、妳可是擁有感知力的人耶！不找妳我找誰啊？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_034@可是……！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_035@好啦，妳別推辭了，我們就快速買完、快速回來，好嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_036@好吧……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_037@哦！這個有鑲鑽的愛心項鍊好像不錯？海莉格妳覺得呢？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_038@……唔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_039@海莉格？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_040@嗯……她一定會很喜歡……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_041@唉，看來今天是很難挑到適合的禮物了，妳就這麼不願意跟我出來嗎……？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_042@……不是的。只是……現在覺得很煩、很悶。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_043@唔、頭好痛……！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_044@海莉格？！妳還好嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_045@只要、只要你不靠近我，我就會好了，請你離我遠一點－－！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_046@海莉格說完之後，頭也不回地離開了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_047@（好耳熟的台詞，難道海莉格的感知又異常了嗎……？）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_1_048@（不管了，還是跟上去好了！）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_001@跟在海莉格後面的我，一路跟回了宿舍，本想找個好時機搭話，但海莉格一回房，就把自己鎖在房間裡。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_002@（無論我怎麼敲門、詢問，都沒有回應……唉）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_003@……海莉格，等妳願意的時候……再跟我說吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_004@就在我正打算放棄、邁步離開的時候，海莉格的房門打了開來。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_005@player……你進來吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_006@妳回心轉意得真快，是感知恢復正常了嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_007@啊？算、算是吧……？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_008@我是因為……感知到了player你難受的心情，而你一難受，我也會跟著難過，所以才……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_009@啊啊、總之！重點是－－！我總算搞懂自己是怎麼回事了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_010@這段期間，我躲你是因為我不懂自己身上出現的異常，後來我找了宿舍的大家談過，再加上剛剛的頭痛……我才突然意識到。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_011@原來……這一切是因為我喜歡player。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_013@抱歉，我並不是討厭你，才敷衍你、叫你離我遠一點，我只是……一想到你要送禮物給其他女孩子，心就異常地痛苦。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_014@對不起……沒幫上player你的忙，而且還讓你因為我而感到難受。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_015@明明，這是我最不願意看到的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_016@雖然我喜歡player，但我其實也是最近才搞懂什麼是「喜歡」，所以……你不需要因為我的喜歡做些什麼！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_017@……海莉格，真的很溫柔呢。\n溫柔到讓我覺得困擾的地步。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_018@眼見海莉格神情黯然，我笑著拿出了剛剛在商場購買的、包裝精美的項鍊，將它放到海莉格手上。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_019@但我就是喜歡這麼溫柔的妳，所以才想買禮物送給妳，告訴妳我有多喜歡妳。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_021@不懂什麼是「喜歡」，還是「愛」什麼的，都不要緊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_022@反正，時間還長，我會用我的行動，一點一點告訴妳的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_023@我一手輕撫著海莉格燙紅的臉頰，一手握住她纖細又柔軟的手。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_024@海莉格一臉彆扭，迅速地將我的雙手拍開。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_025@上次在海邊被我碰，妳也是這個表情，是不舒服嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_026@不是，是、是太舒服了－－！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_028@我想……是因為感知力吧，所以當player你碰我的時候，我對你的喜歡、你對我的感受、雙方的觸感……等等的，全都會融合在一起。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_029@這是我從未有過的舒服感受……我、我身體還沒辦法習慣啊！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_030@既然這樣，那更應該多碰一點，讓妳習慣啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_031@我一把拉住海莉格，將她拉到我身旁，然後捧起她的手，在手背上輕輕地吻了一下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_032@怎麼樣？感覺不錯吧？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_033@啊－－！Player你！不可以這樣！不、不對！也不是不可以！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_034@看見海莉格因害羞而不知所措的模樣，反而勾起了我想調戲她的心。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_035@我將她摟進懷裡，在她看不見的時候露出壞笑。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_036@嘿嘿，這樣又如何呢？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_037@player！你絕對是故意的吧－－！！可惡……！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_038@海莉格嘴上雖然這麼說，卻沒有掙脫我的擁抱。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_039@……player的身體，好溫暖呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_040@妳喜歡被這樣抱嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_041@雖、雖然是第一次，不過……還真是舒服。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_042@海莉格直率的表達實在是讓我心癢難耐，所以我趁海莉格不注意，朝她的臉頰親了一下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_043@啊、什、剛剛那是－－！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_044@既然知道妳的感知力會如此，我就不會輕易放過妳了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_045@妳放心，我以後……一定會讓妳只有美好的感受。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_046@……player……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_047@那你不能再這樣捉弄我了，不然我的身心都會受不了的！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P035_N_2_048@不過，我會好好期待的……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_001@Thank you for your reservation. Your hardwork is appreciated.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_002@Alright, thank you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_003@I leave the shooting range with a smile on my face. I've successfully booked the training schedule for the month. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_004@Hopefully, the girls that aren't as proficient at handling squirt guns can get some practice in. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_005@Just as I was getting ready to leave, I hear the crisp sound of a gunshot coming from the shooting experience area. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_006@I look over and see a sharply-dressed girl with her back to me staring off into the distance.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_007@The handsome looking girl gives off a composed air as her dark hair with highlights sways in the wind. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_008@I take a closer look and see that she just hit a bullseye!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_009@Are you kidding me? It's only her first shot and she's already so accurate?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_010@I watch in awe as the girl continues to shoot round after round. \nIt looks like she isn't even trying, but she has yet to miss a shot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_011@I won't forgive myself if I let someone as talented as her slip through my fingers. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_012@I look over once more and see the girl is packing her things and getting ready to leave. I'll need to hurry up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_013@After making up my mind, I walk over and say hi.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_014@Excuse me, do you mind if I take a moment of your time? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_016@Do solicitors come to shooting ranges now too? Sorry little guy, I'm not interested. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_017@The girl jokingly dismisses me and shoulders her bag as she prepares to walk around me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_018@No, wait. I'm the coach of a squirt gun team, not some salesman...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_019@A coach... of a squirt gun team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_020@That's right. My name is player. I'm actively recruiting new members to increase the strength of my team. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_021@I saw how accurate your shooting was just then and you're just the type of talent we need. That's why I must ask, would you be interested in joining my squirt gun team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_022@Hehe, I see that you have ambition. I like how you got straight to the point. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_023@I recall that squirt gun members are categorized as professional athletes, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_024@Unfortunately, I already have a full-time job and it's one that I'm loathe to leave. I'm afraid I'm going to have to turn you down. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_025@I feel my heart sink as I don't know when I'd be able to find someone as exceptional again. I'm not willing to give up any possible opportunity.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_026@It's fine if you don't sign as a former member, you can always come help out during your spare time as a shooting instructor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_027@I'll be sure to pay you handsomely. I hope that you can consider my proposal!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_028@Hmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_029@You really do have an unwavering spirit, fine. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_030@The girl maintains her mysterious smile and hands me a business card. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_031@I'm swamped at work right now and won't be able to take time off. \nIf Coach really needs my help, you can come find me at work. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_032@Well, that settles it. I'll be seeing you around.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_033@The girl leaves after telling me where to find her and I take the opportunity to look at her business card. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_1_034@Tiffany, Animal Protection Association Breeder
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_001@I follow the address on Tiffany's business card and arrive at the sanctuary she works at. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_002@The bright environment is much cleaner than the picture of a dark musty place in my mind. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_003@As I was craning my neck looking around, a volunteer noticed me.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_004@Hi there, are you here for adoptions?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_005@Ah, no. I'm looking for a girl called Tiffany?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_006@Oh, you're a friend of Tiffany's? One moment please. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_007@I don't have time to explain my relation with Tiffany before the volunteer runs off to find her. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_008@On second thought, it might save me a lot of hassle not having to explain too much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_009@The volunteer doesn't leave me waiting for too long before I see her with Tiffany in tow. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_010@I'll leave you two to it. If you guys need anything feel free to let me know!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_011@Tiffany smiles and waves at the volunteer before turning back and looking at me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_012@Just as I thought, you came here to find me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_013@I know you came here to talk business, but seeing how you're already here, I'll take you on a tour. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_014@That'd be great. I'm also quite curious about the inner workings here. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_015@Tiffany starts the tour off with the kennels and the dogs inside look at my with curious eyes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_016@The job isn't anything special. \nI'm mainly just in charge of feeding, cleaning, and taking them out on walks. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_017@Each person will take care of 10 or so animals each day. \nSo it is also important to become familiar with them and know their temperament. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_018@Take this dog for example, his name is Pocho. He's very active and full of energy. When I take him out for walks I need to spend more time playing with him. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_019@It sounds quite normal, but on second thought it doesn't seem like an easy job at all. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_020@I can't imagine how a person that is so selfless in taking care of animals would be so accurate with a gun.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_021@Wel... about that. My gunmanship doesn't have much to do with my profession. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_022@I come from a family of hunters, so it's perfectly normal for me to be trained in gun handling. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_023@A family of hunters?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_024@I can't picture the passionate girl in front of me as a cold-blooded hunter that hunts animals. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_025@Can I ask you why you want to work at the Animal Protection Association?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_026@When I turn back to look at Tiffany, I stop dead in my tracks like a deer in the headlights. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_027@Tiffany still has her signature smile, but she now has a gun aimed straight at me. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_028@Some things... are better left unanswered. Don't you think that'd be best for everyone, Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_029@Tiffany speaks with a calm voice, but she gives off an intimidating presence. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_030@There's no other witnesses around. If I piss her off and she decideds to off me, no one would know...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_031@A sheen of sweat covers my brow as I subconsciously raise my hands in the air. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_032@I'm just messing with you, haha~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_033@Tiffany puts down her hunting rifle and returns to her professional smile. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_034@By the way, I think it's a perfect opportunity to talk about the shooting instructor job. Let's go to the meeting room over there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_035@Tiffany casually leaves the kennel, but I'm already soaked in sweat. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_2_036@It was then that I finally discovered Tiffany's polite smile was just a facade. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_001@I had agreed to the time of the first class with Tiffany, but it's already 10 minutes past the arranged time and she is still nowhere to be seen.   
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_002@Maybe she's so busy that she forgot?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_003@Seeing how devoted Tiffany is to her job, I don't think that will be the case...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_004@Dang, she isn't picking up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_005@What a pity... I was really looking forward to learning more about hunting from this instructor... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_006@Seeing Riria's sullen expression, I also think that I shouldn't let the girls wait any longer. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_007@What if something really happened to Tiffany on the way here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_008@I'll go out to look for her. I'll leave things to you here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_009@I hurriedly leave the training ground and head over to the police station to seek assistance.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_010@As I take a shortcut through the park, I see a familiar figure in the bushes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_011@Tiffany? What are you doing hiding here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_012@Shh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_013@Tiffany doesn't seem willing to say more. I follow her gaze and see a man taking his dog for a walk. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_014@Tsk, I'm going to be late at this speed!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_015@Hey! Are you playing deaf? I told you to hurry up and take a dump already!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_016@The man berated his dog angrily and got his point across with kicks. The dog whimpers with each kick. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_017@What a bad temper, don't you think? Eh...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_018@In an instant, Tiffany has her hunting rifle aimed at the man. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_019@I've finally got you now... you scum that abuses animals...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_020@Wait! Stop!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_021@I rush to push Tiffany's gun away and she loses her balance. The gun goes off with a loud bang as it shoots off-course.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_022@Did you really plan on shooting someone with a real bullet?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_023@W-What was that? It sounded like a gunshot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_024@I better get out of the way... \nHey you mutt, stop taking your time. Let's go already!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_025@The nervous man hurriedly picks up his dog and escapes. He doesn't even bother to pick up his dog's turd on the ground. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_026@I let out a sigh of relief, but the chill I feel behind me reminds me that things aren't over yet. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_027@Why... did you have to poke your nose where it doesn't belong? Why did you stop me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_028@Do you know how hard it will be to track him if I let him go now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_029@If he's a repeat animal abuser, wouldn't it be better to report him for animal cruelty?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_030@That's too slow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_031@New cases of animal cruelty pop up everyday. It's pointless to rely on the inefficient police to get the the bottom of these crimes. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_032@I discover that Tiffany's obsession is way more intense than I imagined when I hear her voice her opinion. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_033@So you think it's better for you to commit murder and be locked away?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_034@I don't understand your reasoning. People and animals are both living things. \nWhy did you give up hunting if you're just going to raise your gun at humans now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_036@You're asking a lot of annoying questions. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_037@I told you before, you don't need to know too much. It doesn't help the situation at all.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_038@It does help when it comes to us. \nI want to help you, Tiffany. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_040@In addition, you've already agreed to be an instructor of my team, but you missed your first class already. Of course I would be obligated to find out what's going on, don't you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_041@... Fine, I guess you're right.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_3_042@I'll make an exception for you, but if you don't listen up I won't say it again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_001@It was a snowy night many many years ago. I was trapped on the mountain with a couple of my friends due to an accident. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_002@What do we do, this blizzard doesn't seem to be letting up anytime soon...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_003@Our cellphones and the satellite phone aren't working. We're also running out of food. Will we really be able to hold out until we're rescued? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_004@There's no point worrying now. We can just do our best and not give up hope. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_005@That's right. We're already lucky to be able to set up a temporary camp at this relatively low ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_006@Bark! Bark Bark!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_007@Puck, are you worried about me too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_008@No matter how cold it is, I feel warm when I'm hugging you. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_009@Wimper~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_010@Heh, you're still the one that understands me best, buddy of mine for five years. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_011@Don't worry, we'll make it home safe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_012@In the following days we took turns shoveling snow, finding food, and looking for a way down the mountain. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_013@Each attempt at leaving was only met with disappointment. A couple of days passed like this with no new progress. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_014@One day, I woke up to the sound of a gunshot. \nBut it was already too late.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_015@What's going on... Eh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_016@Puck...? Puck!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_017@Why did you kill him... He did nothing wrong...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_018@Did nothing wrong? Are you talking about this useless dog that's only a burden on our food stores and is of no use?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_019@With his meat, we will be able to hold out a while longer. He's much more useful dead!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_020@But... Puck's our companion...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_021@Tiffany, you care too much about your animals. They're just subsidiary to humans and are expendable!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_022@For our survival, his sacrifice was necessary...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_024@Wahhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_025@Say it one more time... Who is just a subsidiary? Say it!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_027@Tiffany! Calm down!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_029@That's the first time I turned my gun on a human.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_030@If no one had stopped me, he probably would have been our next source of food.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_031@Is that why you renounced being a hunter?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_032@I started taking care of animals to atone for being unable to protect Puck.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_033@Furthermore, I can't let them off the hook so easily. I'm sure that there are even more selfish people out there abusing their pets.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_034@Human and animal lives are both important, I won't deny that. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_035@But people that don't respect other lives first will never gain my respect, do you understand?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_036@I'll deal with this my own way, so can you please stay out of my business?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_037@You should have told me about this earlier.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_039@ From the day you agreed to help my team out, I've already treated you as my own team member. I can't sit idly while you're in need.  
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_040@If you had told me earlier, I would be able to find the best solution to your problem. It isn't too late right now. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_041@We have a lot of talented members in the squirt gun team. They have thousands of ways to find these animal abusers that are so hard to track down. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_042@It'll be much faster working together than you struggling on your own, don't you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_043@Working together...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_044@That's right. Those people will be brought to justice. Killing them is letting them off too easy. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_045@I know that your trust was betrayed once before, but I can vouch on the honor of my squirt gun team that I won't betray you. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_046@Of course, whether you choose to believe me is up to you. \nWhat's your answer?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_047@... Haha, what an interesting man you are.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_048@Kind and compassionate, determined and unwavering... You might be even more suited to taking care of animals than me, Coach. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_049@Fine, I conceed. Do note that I will be observing you to see if your attitude is reflected in your actions and worthy of my trust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_4_050@Here's to working together, Coach~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_001@Coach, you sure do swing by often these days. Could you be considering adopting a pet?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_002@Tiffany jokes with me as she pulls a ladder up next to a rack in the sanctuary's warehouse.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_003@Well... I have been considering it, but there are really too many cuties to choose from.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_004@Haha~ Take your time. No matter which dog Coach chooses I can also help take care of it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_005@By the way, do you need a hand? These bags of dog food look pretty heavy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_006@It isn't my first day on the job. I can handle a few bags of dog food, there's no need to worry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_007@This is a walk in the park for... Ahh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_008@Tiffany has just picked up a bag of dog food before she immediately loses her balance and falls off the ladder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_009@Watch out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_010@I immediately catch Tiffany from her back. However, I fail to maintain my balance and end up falling onto the ground with her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_011@Tiffany, are you alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_012@I'm okay... How about Coach? Did you hurt anywhere?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_013@Ugh, it hurts a little.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_014@Though I say my body hurts, after feeling Tiffany's soft body and fragrance, it doesn't hurt that much anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_015@But it's okay. Let's get up and clean the mess.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_017@Tiffany? Is there anything wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_018@Ah, sorry. Nothing. I just feel... a little be comfy lying on Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_019@Tiffany says bashfully, which finally makes my libido conquers my rationality.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_020@Tiffany, do you want to try something even more comfortable then?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_021@While I ask, I slide my right hand up from Tiffany's waist and lightly pat on her plump breasts to check her willingness.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_022@Don-Don't... Coach, if someone sees us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_023@Tiffany refuses me verbally. But she doesn't move my hand away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_024@This encourages even more. I reach my left hand into Tiffany's shorts and whisper to her ear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_025@If you don't want anyone to see us, how about we just finish it fast?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_026@I bet you're looking forward to what I'm about to do next, aren't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_027@After the question, I can feel my fingers getting moist from her slit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_028@Um... Well... I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_029@Your mouth down there is more honest. Then I'll take it as a Yes~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_030@I immediately take off Tiffany's shorts and my pants to let my cock stand between her thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_031@While I pull her shirt up, I rub my cock against her clitoris.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_032@Aaah... Really now... Coach is acting like an impulsive beast right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_033@I really am. Because Tiffany looks just like a tasteful prey to me now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_034@The rifle elite who used to hunt all around the wild is now a helpless prey of mine. Just by thinking about this, I'm turned on so badly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_035@After my cock is fully coated with Tiffany's nectar, I insert it into her right away because I can't wait any longer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_037@How... how is it that big... I can't... Haah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_038@Aren't you worried about being found by someone? Is it really okay to moan this loudly?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_039@I smirk while moving my waist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_040@Uuuah! Coach is such an... evil beast... Haaumm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_041@I can see Tiffany trying hard to lower her voice, which is very interesting to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_042@While thrusting her hard, I start to knead Tiffany's huge breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_043@Tiffany, your breasts are really huge. I really love the feeling of holding them in my hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_044@Don't s-say something this direct!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_045@The shameful feeling makes Tiffany's nipples become erect. I can't help pinching them for a bit more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_046@Yeeehh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_047@How does it feel, Tiffany? Does it feel even better?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_048@Yes... Yes... Do it harder... and come in deeper!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_049@Even though it's hard to do it due to our position right now, but the desire to hear Tiffany's louder moans is a strong motivation to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_050@I arch my knees to lower my center of gravity and pump my butt up powerfully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_051@Yyyaaaahh! It feels... Aaahh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_052@As Tiffany moans, she grabs my hands onto her breasts to knead them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_053@This is when I realize that her natural instinct is craving more sexual stimulation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_054@Woah, I didn't expect Tiffany to be such a pervert~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_055@Aah... I can't... I can't think about anything right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_056@The way how Tiffany's pussy contracts when she moans makes me feel amazing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_057@Do you mean... the only thing you can think about is when I'll make you cum?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_058@Explain it any way you want... Shoot it out already haaaahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_059@Oh? I didn't hear what you just said~ How about begging me once more?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_060@I say playfully while making nasty squishy sounds.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_061@I said... Make me cum nowaaaahh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_062@Before Tiffany finishes her sentence, I punch my cock up brutally once again while shooting out a whole load of sticky cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_063@I really love how her begging voice turns into a scream of climax...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_064@When I still have Tiffany in my arms, we hear someone running towards the warehouse.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_065@Tiffany, is there anything wrong?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_066@As soon as she hears the voice, Tiffany bounces up and pulls down her shirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_067@No-Nothing! There was a cockroach! I've already killed it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_068@As she shouts outside to her coworker, she moves towards the corner of the warehouse with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_069@The panicked Tiffany looks oh so cute.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_070@Got it... Then I'll go to greet the next visitor!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_071@We finally feel relieved after Tiffany's coworker walks away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_072@Hahh... Coach, you'll have to clean all this mess...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h1_073@I don't hear any anger from her tone, so I guess Tiffany and I have become closer through this incident.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_001@Today's a rare day off. I decide to feel the nature by hiking, so I invite Tiffany, who has many hiking experiences, to come with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_002@In the middle of our way to the peak, we decide to take a small rest in the cool shade of a tree.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_003@This place makes me recall some memories. I had come to this mountain when I was a hunter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_004@Oh? Feels like you've experienced many things on this mountain.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_005@Not so many. But there's something I still remember clearly now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_006@When I was looking for prey, I incidentally saw two wild deers mating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_007@If I just shot them both together, it would be a bountiful harvest for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_008@But when I lift my rifle, Puck kept bumping his nose against me as if he was asking me to leave.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_009@Maybe he didn't want me to sabotage the couple's happiness. I'm also happy that I didn't shoot the deers, or I must be regretting now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_010@Wild animals mating... I've only seen it on TV.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_011@Animals can mate in the wild without caring about others or feeling shameful. Don't you envy them a little?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_012@Coach, you feel so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_013@Tiffany asks while pointing at my chest with her finger.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_014@How about experiencing it right here, right now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_015@Uh... You mean...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_016@Before I can realize it, Tiffanny has already taken off her top and trousers and thrown them away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_017@Hehe, I don't think it's a big deal for a nasty pervert like Coach, is it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_018@Her alluring smile makes me sweat a little. Should this be Tiffany's revenge for what I have done to her in the warehouse last time?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_019@The contrary of her smile and her mind is actually kinda scary!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_020@As Tiffany walks towards me, I keep stepping backward and eventually stumble on a stone and fall onto the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_021@Before I can get up, Tiffany sits on me with her tender thighs pressing against my body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_022@I'm not letting you go~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_023@Even though I know that Tiffany is going to toy with me, I still don't want to resist because of her soft body and nice fragrance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_024@After all, it's not every day that I have a chance to have sex with a girl with such a curvy body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_025@While she unbuckles my pants, I take off my shirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_026@I remember you mentioned that you love my breasts. I wonder what you're going to do with them now~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_027@Tiffany cups her plump breasts and sways them in front of me, and she even leans down closer to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_028@Do you have an urge to... taste them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_029@I really can't say no to such a seductive invitation, so I grab her right breast and start to lick on her areola.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_030@Haah... Coach, you're just like a newborn animal~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_031@Does it taste good, Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_032@Of course! It's perfect!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_033@I lick on Tiffany's nipple as if licking on ice cream, making her moan slightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_034@Since Coach likes my breasts so much, please focus on enjoying them~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_035@And leave other things... to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_036@I can feel Tiffany holding my cock to rub against her moist slit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_037@I'll show you the feeling of being unable to do anything but cumming~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_038@She grips my cock and slowly inserts it into her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_039@Aah... This time... the whole rod is inside me... It's a little bit too deep... Haahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_040@The pleasant sensation and the stimulation on my ears turn me on badly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_041@But I think I still have a chance to take back my advantage. I can't lose at the very beginning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_042@So I open my mouth to hold Tiffany's whole areola in my mouth and start to suck on it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_043@Meanwhile, I keep kneading her left breast brutally to give her extra stimulation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_044@Uuaah! You... seem to be very energetic. I'll have to work harder then...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_045@Tiffany starts to move her butt. But she seems to be fighting against the overbearing pleasure of my glans hitting on the depth of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_046@I have to say, she is really good at clipping cocks with her pussy. It's so tight that each penetration impresses me very much.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_048@How is it?... Feels good, huh? Coach, do you feel like getting back animals' original instincts?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_049@... Why are you so happy just because I moan once? Are you underestimating me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_050@I keep caressing Tiffany's and tasting her breasts while she pumps up and down hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_051@Though we can feel each other's warmth on our skins, we focus on taming each other.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_052@However, after a while, we don't consider winning or losing important anymore. Instead, we're just following our natural desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_053@Surrounded by the squishy sound and our ecstatic moans, we change our focus on sex itself. Nothing can affect our craving for each other now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_054@Soon, I feel I'm reaching my limit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_055@I'm cumming!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_056@I vent out the whole load of cum accumulated in me powerfully into Tiffany.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_057@Yaaaaaahh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_058@After a lusty moan, Tiffany lies down on me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_059@We just lie there for a while to let the smell of grass ease our tiredness.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_h2_060@This... is really addictive...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_001@總算是跟教練先生開完會了，下週的課也得好好準備才行……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_002@嗯？貓叫聲？原來教練先生住的社區也有不少流浪貓嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_003@今天沒什麼急事，過去看一下好了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_004@喵喵！咪喵喵喵～！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_005@喵嗚？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_006@喵喵嗚咪！喵呀喵喵！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_007@喵──！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_008@（那個金髮的，不是我上次教到的女孩嗎？\n原來她有貓語技能啊，真特別呢。）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_009@咪嘿嘿～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_010@（竟然直接趴下去蹭貓……？）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_011@（對了，教練先生好像說過她有貓的習性來著……\n該不會是被貓叼去養大的棄嬰吧？）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_012@啊，蒂芬妮老師，晚上好喵！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_013@晚上好，妳在跟小貓們聊什麼呢？牠們看起來都很專心地聽妳說話呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_014@露娜在跟牠們聊晚餐呀喵！像是哪邊的垃圾桶能翻到好吃的便當、哪一區的蟲蟲跟老鼠最肥……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_015@露娜的每一個口袋名單他們都很贊同喔喵！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_016@嗯……雖然跟貓咪們交朋友是一件很棒的事情，但是……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_017@露娜這麼常模仿貓的行為，真的沒有問題嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_018@喵呀？！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_019@（糟糕，老習慣改不掉，如果跟老師說我本來就是貓，她一定不會相信的……）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_020@那個……露娜只是喜歡觀察貓而已，其實不太懂得怎麼做對他們會比較好……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_021@這個嘛……其實不需要想太多，我就教妳一個最簡單的吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_022@身體不需要趴得太低，只要蹲著就很夠了。稍微等一段時間讓牠們願意自己過來靠近。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_023@然後伸出手在牠們的鼻尖前面讓牠們聞，等到牠們認為妳很安全以後……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_024@妳看，就會像這樣頂我一下，這樣就可以摸了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_025@通常像是摸額頭、搔下巴，或是從後頸一路順著背摸到屁股，對貓咪來說都是舒服的哦。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_026@全、全都講中了！老師好厲害……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_027@如果發現流浪貓有點太多的話，也可以跟我說，我會聯絡同事把牠們帶去園區照顧的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_028@唔……可是這樣露娜就沒辦法天天跟他們一起玩了，有點可惜喵……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_029@不如這樣吧，露娜要不要跟我一起去園區的貓舍呢？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_030@就當作是幫忙看看那邊的環境適不適合做為這些貓咪的新家吧？說不定還能讓妳交到新朋友呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_031@新朋友？真的嗎？那我想去喵！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_1_032@沒問題，我們走吧～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_001@好，今天的準確度訓練就到這裡，下課。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_002@謝謝老師──！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_003@呼，終於可以休息了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_004@像這樣幫教練先生的隊員上課也有一個多月了吧……但是教練好像因為要討論宣傳的事情，又開始變忙了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_005@他真的有記得要幫我找虐待動物慣犯的約定嗎……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_006@哎，真虧你敢信任那傢伙，我倒覺得妳還是別抱太大的希望比較好～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_007@誰？！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_008@是我啦，呵呵～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_009@哦？這位姐姐的cosplay服裝真是漂亮呢，妳好呀～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_010@誰說這是角色扮演了？我可是堂堂大妖狐桔梗，休得無禮！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_011@妖狐？原來這世界上真的有妖狐嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_012@沒錯，同時也是栽在妳口中那位教練先生底下的受害者。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_013@想當初我只是小小的對他惡作劇了一下，他竟然反過來陷害我，還抓了我的尾巴！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_014@對妖狐一族來說，被抓尾巴是屈辱，所以我被長老懲罰來這裡侍奉他，同時要重新修練直到能殺了他為止。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_015@於是他說，只要我幫他打贏兩萬場水槍競賽，就同意我殺了他，害我以為很簡單，結果實際上根本不可能……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_016@所以變成妳要服侍他一輩子嗎？聽起來還真是慘呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_017@更慘的是，他早就已經掌握我的把柄了，三不五時就會調戲我……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_018@……等等，妳在幹嘛？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_019@哇，原來真的狐耳長在人的頭上會是這樣子呀～？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_020@不要亂摸我的耳朵！不然我可要生氣了……呀啊──
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_021@所以這個位置本來有尾巴嗎？感覺真的有一小撮不太明顯的毛……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_022@住、住手！那裡不行啊！我會……哈啊……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_023@嗯？一般的狐狸如果摸屁股不會這麼敏感吧？看來是新發現呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_024@那接下來試試看下巴跟臉頰好了，我摸我摸～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_025@是把我當狗了嗎？妳這個過分的女人……唔……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_026@（可是，真的好舒服……該死，她為什麼都知道我的罩門？）
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_027@對了～我記得，揉肚子對犬科的健康也很有幫助的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_028@園區的狗狗都很喜歡搶著讓我摸肚肚喔！妳能獲得VIP體驗真的賺到了呢～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_029@啊、啊啊……我真的不行了……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_030@呀，好乖好乖～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_031@啊哈哈，蒂芬妮果然很不簡單呢，連大妖狐桔梗都能治得服服貼貼啊。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_032@主……player？！你到底什麼時候來的？！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_033@這個嘛，大概從妳對蒂芬妮說我的壞話時就開始了吧。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_034@抱歉啦，蒂芬妮，希望剛才我的僕人沒有太為難妳。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_035@什麼嘛……這惡劣的笑容……真是氣死我了……可是我的力氣……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_036@並沒有哦，桔梗很可愛呢～我相信日後也能跟她相處得很愉快的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P036_N_2_037@天啊……我到底什麼時候才能擺脫這間宿舍啊……玉藻大人救救我呀……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_001@This afternoon, the girls went to the movies together.\nIt's a rare opportunity for me to watch TV in the living room alone without their disturbance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_002@Yawning boredly, I see a piece of special news...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_003@We've got some breaking news for you.\nThe famous celebrity family of the city is offering a high bounty to find their missing daughter Scarlett, who has left home for unknown reasons...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_004@I can't help gasping at the amount of money shown on the news.\nWith that amount of money, I can retire right now and even buy a small island in the South Pacific!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_005@But where on earth can I find the rich young lady...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_006@The laughter of the girls from the outside of the dorm soon breaks my fantasy of becoming a billionaire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_007@Coach~ We're hungry~\nI want to eat something fancy~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_008@Sigh~ I'll never get such opportunities...\nStop daydreaming, player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_009@I get up in the middle of the night to pee.\nJust when I'm about to fall asleep in the toilet, I heard some faint noises from the empty room in our dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_010@Would it be a thief?!\nThis thought terrifies me so much that I become completely awake!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_011@After quietly picking up the spare bat in the corner of the living room, I sneak towards the empty room carefully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_012@I lean my head against the closed door and listen to the sound inside.\nAfter a deep breath, I open the door with full determination!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_013@Freeze! I've got a bat here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_014@With a bat in one hand, I try to reach the light switch with the other hand.\nIn the lit-up room, the thief standing in front of me turns out to be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_015@Wait! I'm not a thief!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_016@Huh... You must be kidding me! You, you're the girl I just saw on the news...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_017@The girl looks at me with arrogant eyes and an elegant smile.\nIt takes me less than one second to recognize her, the missing daughter Scarlett!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_018@Am I going to be rich?\nIs lady luck finally smiling at me?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_019@I know who you are.\nThough I don't know how you got in here, I do know that the outside world is very dangerous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_020@Hehe... Scarlett... Let me escort you home...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_021@Since you know who I am...\nLe-Let's have a calm conversation first, should we?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_022@I can see Scarlett trying to stay calm but failing to hide her nervousness.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_023@player! Listen to me! Please don't send Scarlett back!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_024@Kagano?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_025@I told Scarlett she could hide in our dorm...\nShe's my friend, so I really have to help her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_026@I planned to have her stay at my home as a temporary shelter, but her mother must have already discovered her if I did so!\nSo this is the only place I can think of...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_027@Ah... I got it.\nNo one can expect her to be in such a shabby place...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_028@Hold on, Kagano. I can understand your desire to help your friend.\nBut Scarlett's family is too rich and powerful for a peasant like me to fight against!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_029@What if her family comes here? How would I explain to them...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_030@Scarlett, could you tell me why you left your home before I make the decision?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_031@What's most important is to figure things out first...\nHow can I help Scarlett without any fear or worry if I don't know why she left her home?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_032@Sorry. I can't tell you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_1_033@If that's the case, I'll have to say sorry, too.\nI refuse to help you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_001@Scarlett stares at me emotionlessly.\nNeither of us is willing to give in first...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_002@It's not like I don't want to help her. Even if there wasn't the bounty...\nHow could I just help a random girl running away from her home without knowing anything?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_003@I'm begging you, player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_004@No way. One cocky rich girl is enough for a team, Kagano.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_005@What's more, the team is spending all the budget on expanding the foreign market!\nWe really can't afford to feed an extra mouth...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_006@I, I can donate some money to the team!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_007@... Kagano, this won't work.\nNot everything in the world can be solved with money...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_008@I've heard it from Kagano. Despite the extraordinary performance in the city, your team is having a hard time reaching out to the international market.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_009@Just when I'm arguing with Kagano, Scarlett finally talks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_010@I guess you also know that the domestic market has already been saturated.\nThe international market is doubtlessly the essential target for your team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_011@I'll pay the rent for living here as a subsidy to the team.\nBesides, I'm pretty sure that your team can utilize my overseas connections.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_012@Let me stay as the team's international consultant.\nThis is a deal with only advantages to your side, don't you think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_013@I do understand how tempting the bounty seems to be.\nBut I know... you're not such a short-sighted person.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_014@Instead of the nervous tone I heard, Scarlett now sounds confident with her elegant smile.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_015@I gotta say, what she just offered is really tempting to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_016@Hey... But with such a high bounty there, are you planning to show up on public occasions as a consultant?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_017@player, if there's any occasion that needs the character of the consultant, I'll show up instead of Scarlett!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_018@Scarlett provides her connections in the back while Kagano does the works in the front...\nThis doesn't sound like a bad idea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_019@Seeing how distraught Kagano looks now, I can imagine how close they are...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_020@If player is still worrying about any other potential risks,\nI hereby assure you that the Saionji Foundation will intervene and solve them as much as possible!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_021@Alright, alright. I'll help Scarlett.\nBut I'll clarify one thing in advance. I won't help any other additional trouble happening in the future because of Scarlett!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_022@I have to fix my personality from now!\nI'm just too soft-hearted...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_023@Sigh... Two troublesome rich girls... What kind of disaster will they bring to me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_024@But Kagano was really begging me just now.\nHow could I refuse her?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_025@After Scarlett "moved in," she did keep her promise.\nShe is never late for handing in the rent, and she often gives opinions and suggestions for the team's attempts on the international market.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_026@player, I analyzed a report based on the status of the team in the last season.\nYou might want to take a thorough look.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_027@Ah, thanks! It helps me a lot...\nI can never finish this alone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_028@As for the market expansion in the U.S., we'll have to increase the visibility of the team first.\nI've contacted someone I know in the U.S. to help us with it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_029@Scarlett has even joined several team practice matches.\nI found that her shooting ability is actually quite good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_030@She also gets along with the girls very well. Scarlett's impeccable and perfect performances in all aspects make me more curious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_031@One day, when Scarlett comes to my office to hand in some files, I can't suppress my curiosity and ask her,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_032@Scarlett, so why... did you leave your home?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_033@You were born in a wealthy family. You should be like a duck to water wherever you go.\nWhat drove you away from this natural advantage?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_034@...player, we made a deal on the first day.\nSo please respect my privacy and choice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_035@When it comes to the reason for leaving her home, Scarlett always becomes silent and stubborn like a stone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_2_036@This makes my curiosity gradually sprout along with an unknown bad feeling...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_001@On a rare free afternoon, when I'm taking a nap in my room, I'm woken up by a panicked voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_002@player! Wake up!\nI think they've known Scarlett's hiding in here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_003@Haaahh... What's wrong...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_004@As soon as I hear Scarlett's name, I become completely awake.\nWith the uneasy feeling blooming in my mind, I can feel my heart beating faster out of nervousness.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_005@I run to the living room and see a squad of bodyguards in black shouting at the girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_006@Stop playing dumb! Leave Miss Scarlett to us!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_007@All the bodyguards look much stronger than me...\nBut none of them has the right to threaten my team members!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_008@How would a rich girl hide in some shabby place like here?\nDon't you think you've gone to the wrong place to find her?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_009@Still lying...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_010@See this check in my hand?\nLeave Miss Scarlett to us and you all can live a happy life without any labor for the rest of your lives.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_011@The leader of the bodyguard squad shows us a check...\nAll of us gasp when seeing the number on it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_012@... There's no girl called Scarlett. Please leave here!\nOr I'll call the police!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_013@I take a deep breath and stare at the bodyguards as they put away the check and leave.\nOnce again, I let my billionaire dream slip away from my hands...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_014@After calming the girls down, I knock on Scarlett's door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_015@Scarlett... Are you okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_016@Scarlett is sitting on the bed silently in her room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_017@Those bodyguards have left. Don't worry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_018@... Why are you helping me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_019@You don't know me or the reason I left my home.\nYou could just hand me over for the bounty, couldn't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_020@Yes, I could hand you to them and live a happy effortless life ever after.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_021@But you're Kagano's friend. Besides... I bet you must have a strong reason to give up such a wealthy environment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_022@... player... Thank you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_023@You're welcome. Now that we're kinda on the same boat,\nwould you like to tell me the reason why you left your home?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_024@I ask in a joking tone, not expecting any answer.\nHowever...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_025@... I've always wanted to be a dartist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_026@Don't judge my ability by my look. I'm actually pretty good at it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_027@But my mother wouldn't allow it.\nShe wants me to take over the family business...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_028@All parents are like this...\nThey always hope that their children can make a lot of money and have a decent career.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_029@No, you don't understand! \nShe looks down on everything other than our family business!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_030@My mother doesn't believe me at all!\nShe doesn't believe I can live off the path she planned for me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_031@So... that's why you left your home?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_032@Yes. I don't want to live for other people's expectations anymore.\nAt least... I want to prove what I can do!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_033@I want to show them that I'm not just a fragile flower grown in a greenhouse.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_034@After listening to Scarlett's sincere and heavy confession...\nI suddenly feel ashamed of myself for thinking about sending her home for a bounty before.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_035@It occurs to me that there will be a local water gun competition next month.\nThe game will also be broadcasted on TV.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_036@Scarlett, I've got an idea...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_037@Here's my suggestion for Scarlett.\nSeeing how Scarlett creates a splendid performance for the team might be the most direct opportunity for her mother to witness her effort and ability!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_038@You've practiced with us so many times.\nYou can do this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_039@What if I can't?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_040@Then... we'll figure out some other ways. What do you say?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_041@In an afternoon, Scarlett and I are chatting after a practice match.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_042@Scarlett, you're doing better and better now.\nI can see the dartist inside you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_043@You bet~\nI train a lot when I was studying abroad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_044@Being away from my family, that was my first time to breathe the fresh air...\nI could finally control without any other person's judgment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_045@I guess Scarlett bringing her family up to me is a pretty good sign that she has confidence in her future!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_3_046@It will be the water gun competition a few days later.\nBefore that, I still have something to do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_001@It's the day of the competition.\nI watch the team playing by the court surrounded by OB vans and cameramen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_002@Hold on! Don't rush! They're showing some loopholes!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_003@Paying attention to everyone's movements, I remind them not to fight too impulsively.\nAs for Scarlett, she looks very nervous, yet she's performing as well as usual.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_004@I can't help getting nervous as well while peeking at the VIP seat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_005@Finally, the competition was over.\nOur team got 3rd place.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_006@Well done, girls! Let's go back and have some nice rest!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_007@By the way, Scarlett...\nThere's someone you have to meet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_008@I call for Scarlett, who is talking about the previous battles excitedly with the other girls, and bring her to the VIP seat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_009@... Mother?!\nWhy are you here...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_010@Scarlett, I was going to just send the bodyguards to bring you back.\nBut your coach convinced me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_011@If you want to deny a person's ability, you have to at least see how hard she works in advance...\nCoach, is that what you said?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_012@Scarlett, he-hear me out. I want your mother to see what you are capable of in person...\nIf you're mad at me, I'm very sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_013@Scarlett silently waits for me to finish my panicked apology and finally replies...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_014@…I am not angry.\nI know I must face this sooner or later.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_015@Mother, I think Coach has told.\nI have a goal I want to achieve. And it's never taking over the family business.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_016@But I don't think you can accept this.\nThis is why I left the family.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_017@I've been neglecting your feeling all this time.\nThat's definitely my bad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_018@Come home with me. After all... you're my daughter.\nThere are some things I need to talk to you about.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_019@I'll wait for you in the car outside in the parking lot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_020@Scarlett's mother kindly leaves us some time to say goodbye.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_021@Haha... I'm really sorry.\nDidn't expect you still have to go home after all this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_022@Don't apologize. I have to end this sooner or later.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_023@Actually, I thought you were just a spoiled rebellious girl at first...\nAnd I guess the reason why you had left your family must have been some trivial things.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_024@At first, I just thought you were a scoundrel who only cared about money.\nBut you helped me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_025@No matter what decision my mother makes after going home.\nAt least she has seen my efforts in person.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_026@And I'm not a girl who gives up easily!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_027@player, thank you for taking care of me during this short period.\nPlease also say goodbye to the team members for me. I'm sure we'll meet again some time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_028@Thank you for helping me, too...\nGoodbye, Scarlett.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_029@I watch Scarlett leave with graceful but firm strides.\nI don't know why, but I feel some unknown emptiness in my heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_030@After all, we're in two different worlds.\nMaybe Scarlett will forget all this as soon as she gets home...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_031@In fact, I still think Scarlett is a spoiled girl.\nBut I also know that she's just an ordinary person eager to pursue her own dreams.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_032@What happened in the past few months is just like a dream.\nIt just started and ended so unrealistically.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_033@Another night, I get up to pee but hear a noise from the empty room of the dorm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_034@After picking up the bat, I storm into the empty room and shout,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_035@Freeze! I've got a bat here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_036@Not until the light was switched on did I notice someone has been standing there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_037@player, I'm here to bother you again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_038@Scarlett?! Why are you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_039@Looking at Scarlett, who is now standing just near me, I can barely think of anything to say.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_040@It's a long story. After getting home that day, I talked a lot with my mother.\nShe finally agreed that I can try to do what I like.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_041@But it was not a gift but a deal.\nIf I don't want to take over the family business, in exchange, I have to date the person she has picked for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_042@While I'm still stupefied, Scarlett blooms a smile on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_4_043@So, player...\nI'm here for you to take care of from now on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_001@This night, I just finished taking a shower in my room. \nSteam was still coming off of my body from the heat of the water.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_002@Just as I was about to put on some clothes, Scarlett knocked on my door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_003@Hey, Scarlett. \nWhat's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_004@...player, I wanted to come to ask you about my aim.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_005@We only got third in the last squirt gun competition... \nM-Maybe there's still room for improvement.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_006@Scarlett looked around shyly as she spoke and seemed to have trouble looking at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_007@I follow her gaze and look down at myself... \nI'm still dripping wet from just stepping out of the shower, and only have a towel wrapped around my waist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_008@I see Scarlett's shy expression and suddenly feel a flutter in my heart...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_009@Sure... \nI have a dartboard in my room, why don't we see how you aim for the bullseye.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_010@I take a few steps towards Scarlett half-jokingly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_011@M-Maybe I can throw better than you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_012@Scarlett looks to be even more uncomfortable the closer I get to her, but she still doesn't break eye contact with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_013@Oh? I'll take that as a challenge.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_014@I let Scarlett go first as she aims at the target. \nI stand behind her and place my hands on her hips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_015@I grope Scarlett's body and her plump buttocks through her clothes. \nShe can't help but twitch slightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_016@Nghh... player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_017@Keep going. Don't mind me. A professional athlete shouldn't be affected by external conditions. \nThis is the first step to improving your aim.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_018@Even through her clothes, I can feel the softness of Scarlett's body. \nI snake my hand under her dress and caress her thigh. I feel the warmth and the slight trembling of her legs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_019@Ahh.. player, your hand...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_020@In one motion, I pull down Scarlett's shirt and free her breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_021@Her pink nipples stiffen as they are exposed to the air. \nThey look like they want to be ravaged, but I don't want to comply just yet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_022@Why don't I start your coaching here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_023@I sink my fingers into Scarlett's slit that is covered by her underwear. \nMy towel just happens to also slide off my waist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_024@player, how am I supposed to aim like that... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_025@Scarlett's panties gradually become wet with the juices that leak from her pussy. I slip her underwear further down her legs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_026@With my stiff cock, I fill the space between her legs and ass. \nI start thrusting and enjoy the view of Scarlett's lustful face as she clearly enjoys it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_027@My fingers explore delicately around her pussy. \nI can feel the mouth of her pussy opening and closing as it gives off a steamy warmth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_028@Mhmm... Hah... \nIt feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_029@Your body is responding nicely. I can feel your sincerity for my coaching.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_030@Scarlett's panties still hang halfway down her legs and my cock is already engorged to the point that I'm afraid it will burst.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_031@Without any encouragement from me, Scarlett starts to grind on my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_032@It looks like you lack patience.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_033@I position my cock at the mouth of her pussy and slowly push in. \nHer tight hole is warm and moist and perfectly encompasses my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_034@Hah... It's too big... slow down a little.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_035@Scarlett may be telling me to slow down, but her body is telling a whole other story. \nHer pussy slowly clamps down on the whole of my shaft.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_036@Her wet pussy walls rub against the length of my cock and create lewd wet sounds.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_037@Ah... You're so tight... \nI can see that you haven't been slacking off with your usual training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_038@I grab Scarlett's ass and take control. \nMy cock still slowly penetrates in and out of her pussy and the pleasure gradually builds up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_039@Ngh, ahh… Deeper…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_040@Scarlett is no longer able to pay attention to anything else as she focuses on the sensation of my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_041@My large clock glistens with Scarlett's love juices and her pussy lips are also completely covered.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_042@My cock makes a mess of the love juices inside of Scarlett's pussy. \nI grab her waist and get ready to begin my attack.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_043@I'm going to teach you my secret skill.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_044@I thrust with my cock and pick up the speed of my hips once more. \nThe lewd sounds of our wet bodies can clearly be heard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_045@Our bodies slap together and the sound adds to the hotness of the moment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_046@Mhmm… Ahh… Hah…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_047@Scarlett pants and moans. \nShe is no longer able to form a complete sentence and can only enjoy the pleasure that my cock is bringing her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_048@Clear love juices continue to drip from where we are connected. \nScarlett's sensitive pussy lips are also swollen from the friction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_049@Scarlett continues to use her ass to grind against me and it is even easier to reach deep inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_050@Your cock… Hah… Give me more! Ahh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_051@Scarlett is completely lost to the pleasure. \nShe has thrown etiquette to the wind and submitted herself completely to the cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_052@I continue to pant and thrust even faster as her hot pussy grips at my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_053@Scarlett's ass and lower body are covered in love juices. The sight just adds to the erotic scene.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_054@The sound of our wet bodies slapping together sets the pace for our rampaging lust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_055@Scarlett's moist pussy clamps down on my cock and moves to the rhythm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_056@Wait, I'm going to… Ahh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_057@The continuous pounding of my cock pushes Scarlett towards the climax. \nI hold back the urge to cum and increase my speed and power.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_058@I'm going to cum! Use your body to… take a load of this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_059@As Scarlett's pussy clamps down like a guillotine, I let out a roar and release my seed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_060@The overflowing cum drips from her slit.\nScarlett basks in the afterglow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_061@H-Hah… That was awesome…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h1_062@Well, next time I'll teach you some more techniques to improve your aim.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_001@Tonight I'm feeling a little bit down.\nThere's no special reason. It's just because...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_002@Damn! It's Monday again tomorrow!\nJust by thinking about those financial reports I haven't finished...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_003@Sigh~ Happy time always flies.\nShouldn't the government extend weekends to five days?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_004@Just when I'm getting onto my bed while signing, someone knocks on my door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_005@Scarlett, what's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_006@player... Last time you said you would... teach me some more skills...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_007@Scarlett says bashfully.\nHer shy expression is far different from her usual calm look...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_008@That's just so adorable. I can't help teasing her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_009@Hm? Did I? I don't remember anything about this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_010@How about helping me recall it, Scarlett?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_011@I pull Scarlett, who's staring at me in shock, into my room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_012@Ho-How can I help you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_013@My smart girl, I bet you can think of some ideas...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_014@I slowly unbutton Scarlett's top and take off her clothes one piece after another.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_015@If you don't hurry up, I'm gonna fall asleep~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_016@I urge Scarlett in a joking tone, trying to make her more active.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_017@Then... player, how about lying down there and let me awaken your body memory...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_018@Just as I expected, Scarlett's bashfulness disappears along with her stripped clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_019@Becoming much bolder, the naked Scarlett sits onto my thighs with her back facing at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_020@I can feel the weight of Scarlett's body, the texture, and the thickness of her plump butts, but it doesn't feel heavy at all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_021@The small sound of our warm skins rubbing against each other ignites our flame of desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_022@Scarlett even boldly takes my hand onto her fair breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_023@I can feel my fingers sunk in her tender breasts.\nI can't help kneading her soft meat while enjoying the rare service from Scarlett.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_024@player, have you recalled anything?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_025@I happily accept Scarlett's urgent hint from the question.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_026@Hmm... I might still need some more reminders to recall it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_027@Her warm slit keeps rubbing against my gradually erect cock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_028@I can even feel some nectar oozing out from her slit and the clitoris hiding in it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_029@Has player reached the age to eat ginkgo... ah...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_030@My fingers gently pinching Scarlett's nipples make her moan in surprise.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_031@Along with the moves of my fingers, Scarlett's hip sways unconsciously to stroke on my thighs and cock...\nJust like a horny naughty kitty.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_032@Hehe... Scarlett, is this all the best you can do?\nI thought you could do better.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_033@Scarlett humphs and grabs my erect cock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_034@She then takes the initiative to point my cock at her moist slit and lets her tight pussy slowly swallow my hot meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_035@H-How is it going...?\nI think my method is working... pretty well... Hahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_036@Having her pussy stuffed by my cock, Scarlett can't help slightly swaying her waist to gain a more pleasant sensation from where our bodies are connected.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_037@However, she is holding back her moves because she doesn't want to succumb to her desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_038@It is working pretty well... I might have thought of something...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_039@I really enjoy how my cock is tightly enveloped.\nThe love juices oozing out from her wet warm pussy are screaming for more stimulation from me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_040@From the sweat coming out from her body, I can see Scarlett trying very hard to hold her moans back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_041@Now I'm becoming the one driven crazy by libido...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_042@player, is it beyond what you can handle...?\nI'll now bring your memory back...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_043@As Scarlett says, she begins to way her waist.\nMore crystal clear nectar streams out from her slit and coats my huge tough cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_044@At the rhythmical tempo controlled by Scarlett, my happiness slowly accumulates.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_045@Thanks to our position with Scarlett on top, my cock can easily hit the depth of her, digging out nasty fluids from her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_046@Haah... Hahh... Scarlett, you're pretty good at it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_047@While enjoying Scarlett's service, I keep kneading her plump breasts as well.\nScarlett's swaying butt gives me an extremely enjoyable sensation on both my eyes and my body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_048@I can't help pumping my hip up for a little, bringing out Scarlett's enjoying moans and making her speed up her moves.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_049@Uhm... player... Yous is really huge...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_050@She raises her bouncy butt to continue devouring my cock with her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_051@I can feel my cock expanding her tight pussy walls while reaching into the depth of Scarlett.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_052@The lusty squishy sounds and the sounds of our bodies bumping against each other makes the atmosphere of the room even nastier.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_053@Between her soaking wet slit, I can see pink delicate pussy meat being ravaged by me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_054@How about making it even fiercer...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_055@Again, I pump my hips up, making Scarlett moves along with my faster tempo.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_056@Our same desire for an even happier feeling speeds up the penetration.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_057@Ahh... Haaah... I want more... Ahhh~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_058@Throwing her shame and bashfulness to the winds, Scarlett moans loudly for her desire to be stuffed by my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_059@I gasp and grip Scarlett's thighs while doing my final sprint in her. The ferocious moves make love juices splash onto our bodies.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_060@Haah... I'm cumming...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_061@I lift my waist up with full power to shoot a huge load of cum that stuffs Scarlett's pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_062@Being too much for Scarlett to contain, my cum slowly overflows from her contracting pussy after climax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_063@After cumming, Scarlett relaxed her usually straighten body and pants in satisfaction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_h2_064@player, did I successfully awaken your body memory...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_001@這個星期天下午，天氣還不錯。\n我打算趁現在出門去大型家居用品店，買一張新的辦公椅。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_002@當我拿著車鑰匙走出房門時，看見史嘉莉正好也打開房門。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_003@午安，player。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_004@原來史嘉莉在啊…\n我以為大家都出去玩了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_005@對了，史嘉莉你這個下午有其他計畫嗎？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_006@沒有呢…本來正想著讀點書的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_007@那要不要和我去逛逛家居用品店啊？\n我剛好想買張新椅子。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_008@這個問題問出來連我自己都覺得有點好笑。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_009@史嘉莉可是個大小姐，一起去挑辦公椅的畫面實在有點難想像。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_010@好啊…我、我還沒去過家居用品店呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_011@那我今天就當你的司機帶你逛逛囉～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_012@我們在車上有一搭沒一搭的聊著。\n而史嘉莉也說了不少小時候的事情給我聽。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_013@我發現，史嘉莉也並不是那麼不食人間煙火的大小姐。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_014@抵達家居用品店之後，我們悠閒地逛著。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_015@史嘉莉，你覺得這顏色怎麼樣？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_016@我摸摸一組淺藍色沙發，感受著沙發的質感。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_017@嗯…我比較喜歡紅色的～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_018@啊，確實你經常穿著紅色呢。\n那這個看起來怎麼樣？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_019@我坐上一組皮質小沙發，並拍拍我身邊的空位。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_020@來吧～試試看，這坐起來滿舒服的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_021@這組沙發看起來有點小呢。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_022@史嘉莉帶著些微困惑表情，在我身邊坐下。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_023@雖然是小了點，不過並肩而坐一起看電影的感覺也很舒適。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_024@如果還有隻狗的話就更完美了～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_025@player…你感覺就不擅長照顧動物。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_026@這…我還真的無法反駁啊哈哈……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_027@我們連續在不同的家具區域閒晃，一邊談笑著。\n而史嘉莉也很配合我進行各種模擬。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_028@莫名地有種小家庭溫馨感啊……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_029@回程路上，我們一起去小餐館吃了晚餐。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_030@以前我需要的一切都是傭人準備好的。\n所以有很多大家習以為常的地方，我都沒去過。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_031@player，今天…很謝謝你。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_032@別客氣～我也很開心啊！\n不過說起來，好像有什麼忘記了？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_033@我絞盡腦汁想著，卻毫無頭緒。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_1_034@player，你忘記買椅子了……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_001@天氣舒適的午後時光，兩名少女正在大廳喝下午茶。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_002@史嘉莉～這是我從家裡帶來的點心，都給你喔！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_003@華乃，謝謝你……\n這懷念的味道～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_004@自從第二次離家出走後…\n我就好一陣子沒吃到好吃的甜點了～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_005@史嘉莉看著桌上精緻的各式高級甜點，懷念地嗅著香氣。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_006@而華乃則百思不解地發問了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_007@話說～事情不是解決了嗎？\n怎麼又離家出走了？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_008@說來話長……\n母親雖然同意我不一定要繼承家業。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_009@但她要求我必須和她挑選的對象相親。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_010@我連他們的長相都不知道，又怎麼可能會答應呢？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_011@哈啊…太可怕了……\n如果我家裡要我相親，我一定也會拒絕的！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_012@對吧！所以我只好又趁保鑣不注意的時候離開。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_013@還有，經過上次那場水槍競賽…\n我才發現自己的射擊準度其實還不夠穩定呢……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_014@嗯…或許你可以找時間去向player請教。\n好歹他是教練嘛！也有一定的能力。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_015@好，我會的…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_016@史嘉莉一想起這些煩惱，就覺得開心不起來了。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_017@對了！\n我好像從來沒問過史嘉莉你欣賞怎樣的男生呀？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_018@斯文型？還是運動型？
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_019@欸、怎樣的男生嗎……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_020@你突然這麼問，我也……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_021@突然一道熟悉的聲音打斷了她的思考。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_022@哇～怎麼有這麼多點心啊？！\n喔喔！看起來超好吃！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_023@感覺空氣中充滿了甜甜的味道啊～
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_024@是player呀～\n這些是華乃從家裡帶來的點心喔。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_025@我…我可以吃幾塊蛋糕嗎……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_026@欸～不行啦…這是我特地帶來給史嘉莉的。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_027@果然是高級點心啊，這塊看起來超讚。\n那麼我就不客氣囉。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_028@player你聽人說話呀！
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_029@史嘉莉看著兩人的蛋糕攻防戰，想起了剛才還沒回答的問題。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_030@她微紅著臉小聲嘀咕著……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P037_N_2_031@反正我對幼稚的男生沒興趣。
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_001@I was on my way to handle some work at the office, when I saw a few girls crowded in front of the TV, cheering at the screen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_002@Go! Momona! Beat 'em up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_003@Get them all with your Sweet Peach Beam! Go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_004@Y-You'll win for sure!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_005@That's right! Justice will prevail!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_006@It's rare for these girls to agree on something, what on earth are they watching? \nI couldn't help but walk over out of curiosity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_007@The TV screen shows the familiar suburbs of Star City. \nBeside the giant monster, a glowing figure dances and fights.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_008@I won't allow such arrogance any longer, you damned demon!'
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_009@The dancing figure belonged to a blonde girl dressed in a bright and beautiful fairytale-like garment, possessing unbelievable magic powers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_010@Seeing her agility, I thought how great it would be if she was a member of my team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_011@After slipping through the monster's defenses and delivering a series of kicks and punches, the girl retreated into the air and started gathering her magical energy. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_012@Eat this - Sweet Peach Beam of Love and Justice!'
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_013@A pink beam cuts through the demon and purifies it into disintegrating dust. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_014@Yay! She won!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_015@As expected of Momona, brilliant indeed!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_016@Oh, Brother, did you come to see Big Sis Momona?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_017@The first to notice me was Saki. After she asked her question, I realized to my surprise that all four girls had their eyes on me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_018@Er... I was just curious so I took a peek, is this the trendiest kids' program right now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_019@Hey! What do you mean by kids' program? That's so rude of you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_020@Did you think that we were just watching a TV show with Saki? It's not that simple. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_021@We support Momona with all our hearts. She isn't just a kid's dream, she's a hero to adults too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_022@Even though they all looked serious, the fantasy of girls saving the world with magic was unrelatable to me after all, because it was too far from reality.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_023@I looked back at the TV screen. The blonde girl was winking at me through the camera lens.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_024@There will be more spontaneous new episodes in the future, you are most welcome to watch!'
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_025@Huh? Does this show have no fixed schedule?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_026@This is news for you, but Magic Girl Momona is a genuine reality show!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_027@You can never guess when there will be a new plot, but someday she might just appear on your street, chasing after all kinds of bad guys who plan to disrupt the city's peace!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_028@Normally, she would first appear in a live news broadcast. We can only watch the official version after a while.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_029@Some lucky folks who spot her on the streets upload the battle footage they record onto the Internet to brag.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_030@This is the romantic hero story where reality meets fantasy! I live for this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_031@The news? I've been too busy at work to follow it, no wonder I'm out of touch with the latest trends...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_032@Maybe I can not yet understand Momona's charms, but the way this show broadcasts is quite new indeed, it's no surprise that it has garnered attention and popularity.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_033@I didn't think the world would have such a hero to uphold justice, I was hooked since the first episode! \nI admire Momona a lot and wish to keep supporting her!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_034@Momona possesses a special power just like I do. \nSeeing her putting her advantage to good use gives me the courage to face myself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_035@I wish that I could thank her in person one day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_036@Will there be such a day? I looked again on the mischievous and adorable smile on the screen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_1_037@No matter what, this Momona girl has certainly left a clear impression in my heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_001@It's nearing dinner time and I decided to withdraw some money at the bank.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_002@But upon my arrival, I saw that there seemed to be a commotion ahead. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_003@Hey! You guys! Get out here! Hands above your heads!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_004@He- help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_005@Don't act rashly, we've got guns!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_006@Hmph, what bad luck today. Better help them call the police first...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_007@Hmm? Is that...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_008@A girl rushes past me, but just as I make out her face she began emitting a bright light.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_009@Sweet Peach Power - Transform!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_010@When the glow faded, the girl in front of me has transformed into the real Magic Girl Momona.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_011@I was stunned while she had already arrived at the bank in a split second, hit the criminals' hands with her magic beam, forcing them to drop their guns.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_012@Damn it, why are you here, Momona!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_013@As long as there are people who needs help in Celebrity City, I will be there!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_014@So surrender now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_015@I now realize that passer-bys, avid fans and news reporters were beginning to crowd around the place.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_016@Momona! Go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_017@I can't believe I'm seeing Momona in action, I've got to record this historic moment!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_018@Guess things are not going to work out today, run!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_019@Don't you dare!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_020@Momona throws out two balls of light that hit the criminals in the back of their heads, knocking them out straight away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_021@As if that weren't enough, Momona trapped the unconscious criminals into pink bubbles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_022@That's it! Is everyone okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_023@I quickly phoned the police, who arrived soon to capture the two culprits.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_024@If it weren't for Momona, we would probably not be able to catch them so easily. I offer you our thanks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_025@It- it's no problem... I just happened to pass by and help. After all, it's my duty to uphold the peace in Celebrity City!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_026@Momona smiled shyly and seemed to notice me. She waved at me enthusiastically.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_027@I saw you help call the police! Thank you so much!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_028@No worries, anyone would have done so, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_029@I didn't get to finish my question before we were separated by a swarm of reporters who wanted to interview her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_030@The next day, this incident made the news and even made an episode of the ongoing show as Saku had said.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_031@A real life experience being turned into a family program gave me a strange feeling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_032@If the monster on the previous episode was fake, then the incident could have been a pre-arranged show.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_033@However my encounter didn't seem fake, especially the part where I called the police. \nIf this was real, could the monster have been real as well?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_034@The transformation I witnessed, was that just special effects?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_2_035@I couldn't understand these strange happenings until a long time later.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_001@However confusing the incident was, time and team affairs made me forget about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_002@I was racking my brains to garner a little more popularity for my team, but I couldn't think of any publicity stunts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_003@After a meeting with the heads, I was sourly walking on my way back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_004@We won't have much time at this rate. But what can we do without a plan? Sigh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_005@Hmm? That is...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_006@Unknowingly, I had reached a street not far from a certain high school. \nThe girl whom I accidentally saw transform into Momona was walking alone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_007@When I was wondering if I should have called out to her, a group of girls in the same uniform walked by her side.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_008@Still looking sulky and ugly huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_009@That loner attitude is still just as annoying as before.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_010@What college would want a good-for-nothing girl like this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_011@Taunts and laughs that came back and forth finally made the girl stopped.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_012@Are you guys done?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_013@I don't give a damn about what you guys think. We don't know who will have the last laugh yet, losers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_015@Could this be the wrong person? This doesn't look like the same Momona I met at all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_016@Huh, how infuriating!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_017@Breathing the same air as her feels disgusting enough, let's go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_018@After the trio has departed, the girl who resembled Momona glared behind their backs before continuing forward.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_019@Suddenly, an accessory on her backpack gave an urgent cry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_020@Oh no! Oh no! The station at Silver Light District shows an Evil Magic response!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_021@What... at this time again? What a bunch of suckers... \nAlright, I'm going now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_022@The girl answered unhappily, before sprinting off to a dark corner. \nMy instincts tell me that this was a good chance to persuade her, and I follow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_023@When I arrived, her transformation was just complete. We met eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_024@Oh, oh... you are the guy from last time... \nDid... did you see it all?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_025@Er, that's right. To be precise I already saw you by accident the last time, that's why I followed here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_026@Oh no, my secret is revealed, what should I do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_027@Could this innocent Momona be the same girl as before? I was in doubt once again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_028@Since your secret was discovered, we can only erase his memory - 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_029@Hold, hold on, Mr. Pichimo! If we talked nicely, maybe he could help us!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_030@Pichimo? You mean this strange balloon-like creature?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_031@I'm not a balloon! I am the highest King on Peach Planet - Pichimo! Show some respect!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_032@Er... okay...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_033@Mascots don't even know their place these days. What an honorless coach I am...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_034@Anyway, since Momona has said so, I shalt tell thee the truth. \nI know thou art a famous squirt gun coach with some fame who hath been on the news, thou should not break our trust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_035@Even though the outside world sees an edited version of a live shoot, but that has in fact been touched up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_036@I hid behind the scenes, using grand amounts of resources to handle all kinds of video production, managing and financial affairs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_037@Especially when the monsters appear, so long as people believe it was set up, no one would think Celebrity City was under threat from an evil power.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_038@You mean to say, those monsters are actually real?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_039@That's right, so I hope thee would keep this secret, so as not to cause panic in Celebrity City.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_040@I hope that if you have the power, you could help us conceal this from the outside world.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_041@To be honest, I came here in the hopes that you could do me a favor. If you agreed to help me too, we should have a happy enough cooperation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_042@What- what is it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_043@I was hoping you could join my squirt gun team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_044@Oh no! We're running out of time! \nI- I accept! Mr. Pichimo will contact you again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_045@Momona had just finished her sentence when she jumped off into the sky hurriedly, leaving with a dreamy glittery special effect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_046@As expected, she agreed to my request because she was in a rush to head into battle. Everything is going according to my plans!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_3_047@However unrealistic the story I just heard was, \nnow the team has the hottest civilian heroine, I no longer have to worry about popularity and publicity!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_001@Are... are you really Momona?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_002@Yes! That's right! I am your teammate from now on! Let's have a good time together!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_003@Wow~ you are indeed player! \nYou actually got Momona in person, we're gonna be rich!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_004@It took me a great deal of effort to persuade her to join, you fans better cherish the chance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_005@Yup, thanks to Brother, Saki can finally say this in person...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_006@Thank you Big Sis Momona, for protecting everyone's safety!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_007@Please keep up the good work! If you need help fighting crime, I can be your backup anytime!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_008@Oh no, it's embarrassing to hear this from fans up close, eheheh... \nI'm also really thankful for your support!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_009@Seeing everyone crowd together, I decided to give them some space to get to know each other better, so I retreated back to my office for business.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_010@A great deal of effort, how shameless thou art.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_011@Well, it takes a certain art of conversation to coach a team this big. Aren't you the same?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_012@Avert your judgemental eyes, Momona agreed to this on her own.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_013@What was her motivation to become a Magic Girl? \nDoes this have something to do with her pre-transformation character?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_014@Ever since Momona joined the team, I haven't seen her in pre-transformation form. \n It's as if she was hiding something in secret.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_015@I didn't think you would catch on this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_016@Actually, the greater a negative energy, the greater the magical power I can convert.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_017@As you can see, Momona's real character is quite bad, \nher results are not ideal too, so she has always been bullied by her classmates.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_018@She has always hated herself, until I sensed her potential and appeared before her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_019@If she didn't become a Magic Girl, she would probably be unhappier.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_020@Is that so...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_021@Knock knock!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_022@Oh dear! I have another compensation to talk about, I'll take my leave~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_023@The alien creature escaped like the wind. \nI answered the door as if nothing has happened.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_024@Coach, Mr Pichimo is not here is he?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_025@No. What's the matter? Are you looking for him?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_026@No, it's better that he isn't here, or I worry he would expose things at will.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_027@I just wanted to ask you about something...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_028@You can ask anything, go ahead.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_029@I wanted to know, why did you ask me to join your team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_030@Is it for popularity, my fans on your team? \nOr is it... some other reason I don't know about?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_032@I don't deny the reasons you mentioned, \nbut there's a greater reason.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_033@I wanted you to know what it feels like to have partners.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_034@... Partners?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_035@Before this, you always shouldered huge burdens by yourself, didn't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_036@From now on, with so many partners fighting alongside you, you won't be alone again. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_038@This is the first time someone has said this to me... I'm really touched.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_4_039@Thank you, Coach! \nIf there is anything I can do for the team, do tell me in the future!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_001@The vines in the formitory's backyard were turned into monsters by demon aura,' \nI would never have believed such tales.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_002@But after meeting Momona, everything has changed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_003@It's my first time seeing vines twitching this way, it's really quite disgusting...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_004@Hmm, you were the one who said 'it's just a few vines, we can just cut them' and volunteered to come with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_005@Yep, I'm regretting it now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_006@I was planning to gain some exposure for myself by featuring in one of Momona's episode, \nI didn't expect to be so shocked. Heroes really don't have it easy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_007@But since I agreed to help, I have to do what I have to do.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_008@You try and weaken them first, I will seize a chance to finish them off one by one!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_009@What if they know how to regenerate?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_010@Er.. we can cross that bridge when we get to it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_011@That's true, I ought to fight them first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_012@Take this! End your meaningless struggle! Peach Beeaaam! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_013@Momona hopped into the air and fought the vines airborne, seizing the chance to shoot pink beams at them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_014@That should do it, it's time for our combo attack!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_015@Annihilation Beam.. argh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_016@It appears that Momona missed a vine and had her leg caught in it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_017@Help~~ Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_018@The one who was just taunting the enemy to end their meaningless struggle is now struggling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_019@But the more Momona tried to break free, the tighter the vine twisted around her. \nIt even hooked onto Momona's panties in evil humor and pulled them down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_020@Argh!! What are you doing! No- \nCoach! Help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_021@As if satisfied by Momona's cries, her blouse was also pulled down by the vine, \nrevealing her beautiful and full breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_022@I was stunned momentarily by the beautiful sight, and didn't know whether to condemn or compliment the demonic vine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_023@Oh no, that's a surprising turn of events. Seems like we can't edit the footage today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_024@We can only save Momona with thy help, player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_025@Me? What do I do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_026@Copulate with Momona! That is the only way! Hurry!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_027@Mr- Mr Pichimo?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_028@Even Momona seemed surprised, seems like copulation was an undisclosed secret cure? \nBut I was not hesitant about the matter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_029@Firstly it was important to save her, \nsecondly, Momona's fair and delicate breasts and pussy swaying in front of me had already had me going.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_030@Sorry Momona, since this is to free you, please bear with it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_031@Al- alright... I believe in Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_032@Having gotten Momona's permission, I quickly took off my pants and thrusted into Momona's pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_033@Argh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_034@So... this is what copulation feels like... \nI'm... so full...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_035@First time? Sorry, I should have been slower.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_036@It's- it's alright... \nCoach can do it the usual way!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_037@I acknowledged my understanding, held Momona's butt and started to move my waist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_038@Argh... it- it feels good... \nIf I weren't bound, it must feel even better...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_039@Momona's tightly bound body was thrusted back and forth to my rhythm, her round breasts thumping as if they were alive.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_040@No audience or fans could see this. I was in sole enjoyment of this wonderful body, her adorable moans and beautiful scene.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_041@This ecstatic sense of possession sped up my thrusts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_042@Ugh... argh... argh... \nNo way... at this rate I will...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_043@You have to buck up, Momona, Magic Girl should be capable of more than this, shouldn't she?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_044@Even I couldn't tell if I was just trying to encourage her or looking for an excuse, \nbut the urge to vent quickly overcame me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_045@My attention was grabbed by the lewd cries of the civillian hero, her swinging bosom and her vaginal walls which were continuously rubbed by my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_046@I'm about to cum...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_047@Now's the time! Shoot at the demon now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_048@I was startled by Pichimo's cries \neven though I wished to stay longer in it, but it's better to do as the adviser says right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_049@So I pulled myself out, jerked a few times and shot my cum ahead.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_050@Wah~~~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_051@Although I aimed my attack at the vines, some cum unavoidably splattered onto Momona's body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_052@Surprisingly, the vines really began to weaken after making contact with my sperm, slowly releasing Momona.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_053@My powers seem to be increasing as well... Turns out Mr Pichimo was not lying...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_054@Only the ejaculation from the most trusting copulation, can evoke the miraculous power with Magic Girl! \nI finally witnessed it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_055@But we can't use this tactic too often...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h1_056@After finishing off the enemy this time, Pichimo shared the precious footage that cannot be made public with me, but that's a different story.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_001@Suddenly I received a call for help from Momona, saying that she was in a tough battle and needed my help.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_002@I carefully avoided passers-by and patrolling demons to arrive at the alley she was hiding in.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_003@However I was stunned when I arrived.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_004@Coach... you are finally here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_005@The painful Momona was nearly naked, her costume turned into ribbons that floated around her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_006@Anyone could tell that she was in imminent danger of losing her transformation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_007@Momona? What happened?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_008@I held back my beastly instincts at seeing a girl's beautiful naked body and asked worriedly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_009@The enemy was too strong this time... more so than I expected, so my powers were severely depleted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_010@Sorry, I didn't want to ask you for help too often, but this time I seem to have to ask for your favor, Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_011@Or, if it was any later... I will have to turn into the Momona that I despise...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_012@Momona's worried and afraid expression seemed to have touched something in my heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_013@No, your nature will not change how I view you. \nBut since you still can't accept it, I won't let it happen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_014@This is to help Momona restore her powers! Don't have any impure thoughts. \nAfter thorough mental preparation, I took off my pants and shirt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_015@I'm ready, spread your legs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_016@O- okay...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_017@Maybe out of shame, when Momona spread her legs slightly, I saw a few droplets trinkle down. \nThis seemed like the perfect chance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_018@I'll be gentler this time, try to relax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_019@My words seemed to work, her body became less tense. \nThis eased my entrance into her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_020@Ngah... It's still so full...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_021@Coach's... body temperature... is warming me up... \nmaking me feel safe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_022@So long as you like it. I'm going to start moving.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_023@I slowly moved my lower body. The splashes from my thrusting were loud and clear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_024@To let Momona further enjoy this through caressing, I pressed on her breast and began to rub.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_025@Ahhh... This constant stimulation... \nSome kind of special power... is gathering...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_026@She was right. I could see miraculous glows appearing around Momona. \nThis also convinced me that we were doing the right thing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_027@Enjoy it. I'm going to speed up now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_028@I pushed my thrusts harder, trying to pace up the collection of magical power.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_029@Our body fluids were splashing and splattering from my force.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_030@Ahhh, ahhh... it's like I'm... melting... \nfaster, give me more ahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_031@Momona's begging drove me to thrust harder and harder, with the glow around us growing stronger.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_032@Everytime I thrust my shaft into Momona's pussy, the glow gave a bright sparkle.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_033@Even for someone as experienced as me, seeing such a miraculous scene was the first time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_034@Ngah... my body... has never felt this hot... ahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_035@Momona seemed to be entering a trance, only her body thumping from my thrusts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_036@You're doing well, Momona.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_037@Oh no, oh no! I'm cumming, I'm cumming-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_038@I'm about to cum too, this indispensible energy, better catch all of it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_039@Ahhh... please, please give it to me... the fuller the better... \nI beg you... ngah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_040@It's coming!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_041@I grunted slightly, pouring all my semen into her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_042@Nghhhaahhhhhhh-!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_043@Following Momona's desperate cry, the magical power burst into a highlight as we reached orgasm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_044@Hah.. hahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_045@As Momona pants, the magical glow was strong enough to make me have to squint.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_046@I think... I can transform now... thank you Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_047@Even though Momona didn't notice, our act seemed to have been caught by someone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_h2_048@I should notify Pichimo to erase some memories later. I'm hoping his technology recorded the act just now as a gift for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_001@Recently I connected Pichimo with the guys upstairs, and we decided to throw a Magic Girl Momona's fan meeting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_002@If this event was a success, it will raise the attention towards both your program and the squirt gun team.\nBetter work hard!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_003@Although Coach says so, I don't have any experience...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_004@Different from answering questions from reporters, I have to face long queues of Celebrity City residents!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_005@And what am I supposed to perform during the opening? I fight my battles for real every time, what do I know about acting...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_006@What should I do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_007@Excuse me! Do you need help?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_008@You are...Yui?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_009@Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_010@It's alright! I know Yui is an idol singer, you must be better at this than me, so you asking me makes me much more at ease.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_011@Actually, it's impressive enough that Momona is not afraid to face the crowd. You must be especially nervous because it's your first time, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_012@Yes, that's right, I don't know what to do at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_013@Hmm... has Momona ever receive a fan letter? Like letters from someone who admires you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_014@Oh, yeah, mostly from kids. \nThey draw really cute pictures! I love every single one of them!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_015@Then you can imagine switching your gratitude for them into smiles and words - that is a way of giving back!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_016@Gratitude... I see. I feel like I understand how to respond now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_017@But, I still have no idea how to perform. Every pose feels fake... Yui looks so natural at it, how do you do it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_018@It's simple! You just have to think 'I am the cutest, prettiest idol in the world' and keep telling yourself 'I have to show this to make everyone like me'!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_019@Unknowingly, you will want to achieve that, and you'll succeed more easily!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_020@Making everyone like me? I have never thought of that as a purpose, I was just doing what I had to do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_021@Don't say that, it's no mean feat protecting the city! \nMomona should have more faith in yourself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_022@Or how about this, since everything takes practice, I can practice with you whenever you're free!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_023@Really? But don't Yui have your own idol schedule? Will you have enough time?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_024@No problem! To me, it's more important for my friend's performance to go smoothly!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_025@Friend...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_026@Then- then please take good care of me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_1_027@Leave it to me! I hope one day we weill have the chance to perform together!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_001@On a normal workday, I was yawning alone in the office at various documents, when Momona paid a surprise visit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_002@Coach, good morning...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_003@Momona? Shouldn't you be in school by now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_004@That's right, but I realized that my school was flooded with the cars of news reporters...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_005@I heard they were there to corner me... but I have never told anyone which high school I went to! \nIt couldn't have been you, could it, Coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_006@No, how could it have been me? I am busy enough with tournament affairs! Why would I do things that will cause my team members trouble?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_007@Or I will accompany you over to get an idea of things.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_008@Even though I was worried about finishing work, Momona's matters were more important. \nI arrived with her at the crowded school.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_009@Maybe we could use excuses like you were invited by the school to join an event, or that you knew that enemies might be here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_010@But we still have no idea how much they know, that's a pain...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_011@Ah!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_012@What's the matter, Momona?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_013@There was a reporter... he had a photo of me pre-transformation...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_014@Straight into the worst circumstance huh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_015@I'm done for... if Celebrity City knew that Momona had a bad personality, my life is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_016@Calm down, it's too easy to be sad now, don't we have Pichimo to help erase memories?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_017@It's easy for thou to say. It takes time for me to clear so many memories at once, thou must hold these folks.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_018@Hold the reposters? Doesn't feel like an easy task!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_019@Haha, you seem to be in trouble~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_020@When- when did you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_021@I remember these three were the students who taunted Momona.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_022@Surprise surprise, we found out you were Momona. It's too much of a waste for someone like you to be a Magic Girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_023@What a pitiful face of a victim, do you have to be so gross? \nWhy don't you come back at us with bad words like you usually do?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_024@Either way we succeeded in exposing you to the reporters, you're done for with your celebrity career. Better go out and explain the truth so the whole city can have your image shattered!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_026@You people are too much!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_027@Hey, you're one to talk when you're defending a liar. Shouldn't you be explaining all of this? Heh.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_028@Hold on, there seems to be a commotion at the back?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_029@At that moment, the earth around us began to shake.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_030@Three horrendous demon hands suddenly reached out of the ground and captured the three girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_031@Argh! Help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_032@That, that is a new demon! We also see that Momona is already prepared to fight here! Apparently this venue was already booked for the shoot?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_033@The demons caught the attention of the reporters! I will take this chance to handle the memories~ \nThou should know what to do next?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_034@Momona, what do you say?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_036@I know that I can only save the people, \nbut it's not that I'm forcing myself to save them because everyone is watching.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_037@Even if they don't like me, they are still lives that need to be saved. \nThis is what I, a civillian hero must do alone!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_038@Don't be afraid! Hang in there!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_039@It's really not easy for you, Momona...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P038_N_2_040@Maybe the trio will forget about Momona's identity, but at least I will remember what she did today, \nwould that be enough?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_001@It was a sunny and comfortable afternoon. \nI went to the beach as per the girls' request. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_002@They were making a fuss and playing in the sand. \nAs for me, I was opening up a recliner under an umbrella. It was then that I caught a beautiful figure from the corner of my eye. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_003@A girl stood by the water, warming up expertly. \nShe jumped into the sea and swam with ease.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_004@Her every move was nimble and elegant. \nThis caught the attention of the coach inside of me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_005@When the girl swam ashore, I was already waiting by the water!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_006@Hi! You have great posture! \nYou practice a lot, huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_007@I couldn't help talking to her. \nHow great would it be if someone on the team could swim like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_008@Thank you! I practice every day~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_009@When I came to Star City, I discovered this beautiful beach by surprise. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_010@I forget all my troubles when I swim here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_011@The girl's smile was so bright and pure, it made me smile in return.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_012@Oh, so you're new to this city?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_013@Yes, I come from a ve~ry far island. \nThis is my first time being in such a big city, everything looks so new!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_014@The girl had such a lively expression, as if she was filled with curiosity about the city.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_015@Oh right, I haven't introduced myself. \nI'm a Squirt Gun Squad Coach, you can call me player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_016@You had such great warm-up and swimming posture, \nI couldn't help but come talk to you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_017@Ah! Hi, you can call me Hilda!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_018@I'm currently a backup member on the swimming team! \nBut, I don't have a business card...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_019@It's okay~ So you do work in a related field. \nNo wonder you swim so well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_020@Seems like our fields of work are quite similar.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_021@Could you leave your contact info? \nWe might be able to work together...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_022@I found a pen and paper, hoping that Hilda would leave her contact info... \nAfter all, a good team coach can't let a potential talent off the hook so easily! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_023@Hilda took the pen and paper and left her phone number gladly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_024@Anyway, leaving your home to come to an unfamiliar city... \nNot everyone has such courage.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_025@Actually I didn't think I could do it... \nWhen I first came here, I constantly thought of giving up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_026@But my lucky item gave me support and conviction!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_027@Hilda happily showed me the jewelled bracelet around her wrist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_028@If not for this, I might have returned to my island long ago. \nAnd I wouldn't have become a swimmer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_029@The blue jewelled bracelet shone bright in the afternoon sun, \nas though acknowledging Hilda's perserverance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_1_030@And I couldn't help but smile back at that pure smile on her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_001@One afternoon a few days later, I passed by the living room with a file in my hand. \nAngel was watching TV alone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_002@When I was about to urge her to go to practice, I saw that she had something in her hand. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_003@The item glittered under the light. \nThis feeling of deja vu...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_004@Angel... This bracelet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_005@Heheh, player knows his stuff. \nI saw a girl wearing it at the beach a few days ago.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_006@This is an authentic sapphire! It should be able to fetch a good price. \nI can sponsor Sora's church then...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_007@A sapphire bracelet, the beach... \nThe smiling Hilda from a few days ago suddenly sprang to mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_008@Angel, you probably have to return that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_009@I explained about Hilda to Angel. \nAngel was willing enough to return the bracelet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_010@It's good that I had Hilda leave her contact info, and I phoned her immediately to apologize.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_011@Hilda rushed to the dormitory while Angel and I were ready by the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_012@Thank god! \nThank you... for finding this for me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_013@I cried and searched for days, I thought it was washed away by the sea~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_014@Hilda looked just as pure and happy as she did that day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_015@It's nothing, I should be thanking you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_016@I should be thanking you for not suing us... I didn't say this next part. \nAngel apologized obediently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_017@There is a high tea later, stay and chat?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_018@Eh, but i haven't prepared anything. \nWouldn't that be rude...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_019@It won't~ let's go, let's go~ Kana makes great snacks!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_020@Angel pushed Hilda into a seat, while I helped Kana serve snacks from the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_021@Some members aren't here today, so I can't introduce everyone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_022@But that's Kana in the kitchen. \nThe idiot next to you is Angel.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_023@Hey, who are you calling an idiot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_024@Okay~ I'll be sure to remember your names!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_025@Oh right, you said you were a backup swimmer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_026@I think this season's swimming team tryouts are about to begin. \nAre you planning to try out?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_027@I am... actually I've tried a few times. \nBut I've never had much luck...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_028@Although I practice every day, it's no good.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_029@Apparently there are things that you just can't get huh...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_030@The atmosphere became sad, even Angel fell silent...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_031@If that's the case... would you like to try training under me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_032@Hilda shot me a surprised look, while I continued to explain.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_033@I'm a sports coach after all... \neven if it's unrelated to swimming, I think some things are the same in sports.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_034@When I saw you swim last time, I was sure you have no issue with agility. \nSo the problem might lie in other areas.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_035@What do you think? We have a swimming pool!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_036@I smiled as I watch Hilda's glum expression turn hopeful. \nI knew she'd accept.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_2_037@Then I leave myself in your hands, player! \nI would like to become a professional swimmer!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_001@Well then... swim as best as you can! Ready... go!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_002@To pinpoint Hilda's weakness, I wanted her to swim a few laps for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_003@As I had thought, Hilda had no problem with her technique. \nBut her stamina seemed to have room for improvement...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_004@Phew~ even though swimming relaxes me, this is quite tiring~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_005@Hilda, I think I might know your weakness now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_006@You... lack basic stamina.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_007@Eh? Now that you said it... I do get tired easily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_008@I thought it was fine...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_009@You're much better than an ordinary person. \nBut you're up against the swim team tryouts!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_010@So... you must join the team's daily stamina training! \nRun ten laps now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_011@Al- alright! I'll go for it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_012@Even panting and sweating, Hilda's smile never faded from her face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_013@Putting in this much effort for something ought to make you happy sometimes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_014@Hilda gradually became friends with the others after joining the daily training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_015@Angel is especially kind to Hilda. \nIt's not easy for Angel to treat someone this well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_016@Hilda~ have some warm water~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_017@Thank you~ Phew, I seemed to have improved...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_018@That's right, you did! \nYou're a few seconds faster than last time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_019@Maybe Angel is feeling guilty for taking Hilda's bracelet?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_020@But Angel's attitude is making me curious about the bracelet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_021@Hilda, this bracelet is important to you right? \nDoes it have any special meaning?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_022@I asked Hilda who was resting beside the pool.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_023@Yeah, it's back when I was a child. \nIt has something to do with the new neighbor...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_024@Hilda shared a memory with a smile, as she looked at her bracelet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_025@I used to be shy. I would hide away when I saw the new girl next door~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_026@But kids just get along, so we became good friends afterwards.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_027@We always ran to the beach to look for crabs and shells. \nWe imagined we were travelling vendors who roamed around peddling rare items.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_028@She was younger than me so she called me big sister. \nShe'd always tag along behind me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_029@Oh~ so Hilda has a friend you grew up with?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_030@No, they moved away from the island eventually... \nBefore they left, she gifted me with this bracelet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_031@She promised me she'd be back next spring.\nBut I've never seen her since that day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_032@She said this would bring good luck, so I always have it on me! \nIt's just like her accompanying me through tough times.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_033@Oh... so that's the story... \nBut family issues can cause drastic changes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_034@Maybe she had her reasons?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_035@Mmm, I always understood that. \nSo I don't mind, and I'm always happy I met her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_036@To me, the days we spent together are always the most precious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_3_037@Hilda told me with a smile. \nThat time they spent together must be as dazzling as a crystal.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_001@It's finally the day of swim team tryouts. \nHilda set off early.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_002@The rest is up to Hilda, there's not much I can do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_003@Hilda~ don't be nervous! Take a deep breath!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_004@I will prepare great homemade desserts for you when you get back~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_005@Eh~ why is everyone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_006@We couldn't have let you come alone. \nObviously we would bring around the whole cheerleading squad!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_007@I brought the girls to the resting room, and pointed at the noisy team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_008@After the girls had given their well wishes, we were the only two left in the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_009@Don't be nervous, stay calm so you can give your best performance! \nThere's a great feast afterwards!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_010@I tapped Hilda on the shoulder in encouragement. \nI thought Hilda would be nervous, but she seemed just as normal.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_011@Yup! I'll give it my best shot! \nEven if I fail this time there will still be a next time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_012@player, thank you... for training me all this while... \nErm... Can you accept this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_013@The usually-cheerful Hilda was shy all of a sudden. \nShe took out a pretty bracelet for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_014@This is a lucky bracelet that's popular on the island. \nI hope it will... bring you good luck.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_015@Oh~ it's intricate! Did you make this yourself?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_016@That- that's right, it's simple. \nEveryone can make them on the island!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_017@A- anyway! I wouldn't give up no matter what!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_018@Great, keep up the attitude!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_019@I took the bracelet. Hilda and I smiled at each other.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_020@When the tryouts began, the girls and I were waiting while holding our breaths.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_021@As soon as Hilda leaped into the water, Angel led everyone in cheering. \nKana grabbed my wrist while she watched the game, making me nervous as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_022@Hilda placed rather badly in the game. \nShe was the last few participants to swim ashore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_023@What- What a pity... Hilda worked so hard!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_024@It's okay, I was prepared...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_025@We always have a second chance!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_026@Hilda was comforting a sad Kana... \nI was becoming confused as to who was the participant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_027@When the game host was about to announce the ranking, even Hilda seemed nervous.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_028@The last swimmer who made the team: Hilda. \nPlease bring the necessary documents to register on the team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_029@I- I made the team? \nIs this really happening?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_030@Haha, that's right, congratulations! \nYou're a professional swimmer now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_031@Could I be dreaming~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_032@I'm finally a professional swimmer~ thank you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_033@Fresh out of the pool, a towel wrapped around her, Hilda leaped up and hugged me happily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_034@Even though I was all wet from the hug, I was just as happy as Hilda.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_4_035@The girls jumped in the water in high spirits to celebrate the moment...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_001@This afternoon, I invited Hilda somewhere. \nIt was a surprise for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_002@player, what is this place? Such a mystery~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_003@We're almost there, you'll see. \nHold your anticipations!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_004@We strolled across the afternoon beach. \nThe sunlight made Hilda's smile seem even brighter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_005@Soon, we stopped at a secluded cave near the shore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_006@This is...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_007@Hilda entered the cave, seeing shiny ores and crystals. \nThe scene made her speechless.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_008@I discovered this place by accident and thought you would love this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_010@Hilda's reaction was different than I thought. \nI thought she would leap in excitement.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_011@You... don't like it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_012@No, I love it! \nIt... reminds me of my childhood days of cave exploration on the island.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_013@Thank you... I don't know how to repay you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_014@As long as you like it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_015@Hilda showed me an adorable smile, tempting me get closer.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_016@Since we're already here, why don't we do something memorable?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_017@I gave Hilda's slim waist a light hug and began undressing her slowly. \nHilda's skin was smooth and silky, lovely to the touch...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_018@Eh, player, here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_019@Hilda's body trembled slightly. \nFreed from the bonds of her clothes, her ample bosom shook slightly with her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_020@Special occasion calls for a special place.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_021@I licked Hilda's neck from behind. \nMy palm grazed across her smooth thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_022@My hands were on her breasts, feeling my fingers sink into her skin and play with her erect pink nipples.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_023@Hilda let out a few pants as her breathing becomes rapid. \nShe leaned into me, surrendering completely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_024@The fragrance of a young girl dipped in sexual pleasure turns thick in the air.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_025@As Hilda becomes intoxicated from my caresses, my rod quickly becomes erect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_026@Ah- this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_027@My rod lightly rubs against Hilda's slightly wet pussy, biding for a chance. \nHilda seemed to be holding back a moan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_028@You don't have to hold back, Hilda, you have a lovely voice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_029@I encouraged Hilda, who was still shy. \nI felt at the tip of my cock a hot wetness coming from inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_030@Hilda is already quite wet, you should be ready?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_031@The liquid dripping from her pussy spreads onto her butt and my thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_032@I held out my rod, smoothly filling up Hilda's wet pussy. \nObviously an uncharted area, I filled her up perfectly for the first time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_033@Hah - What, is this feeling... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_034@Feels good, right? Let's leave an even deeper impression...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_035@I held Hilda and thrusted deeper into her. \nHer vaginal walls fully engulfed my erect, pulsing penis.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_036@More liquid was secreted from her vagina and dripped onto both of us. Lewd sounds were coming from where I thrusted into her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_037@The ecstasy spurred me to thrust further and made Hilda more driven as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_038@Her vaginal walls were tightly rubbing against my shaft, rising in us a heat that grew steadily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_039@Hilda has shed all her shyness. \nShe showed an expression of full longing... swaying her body to meet the rhythm of my thrusts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_040@Hilda moved her smooth and fair frame, and soft and round ass on me by herself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_041@The lewd sounds from where her pussy pressed on my shaft brought the stimulation onto another level. \nI couldn't resist the urge to hold her waist and thrusted a few times.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_042@Hah. hah... player is in my body... ahh -
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_043@Hehe... you're filling me up~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_044@Hilda was quickly softened by my attacks, leaving her to lay powerlessly on me and receive my advances passively.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_045@I enjoyed the sense of achievement from having conquered a young, shy girl and making her a slave to my rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_046@Hilda's full bottom slaps against my thighs. \nMy shaft stirred the love liquid that dripped constantly from her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_047@Feels great... it's like I'm swimming in the sea...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_048@Hilda held back her urge to moan loudly, so much that she started to sweat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_049@The tantalizing scent of girl's persperation mixed with her love fluids - that should be any man's fantasy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_050@Realizing that, I felt my shaft turn even more erect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_051@Only constant, strong thrusts to fill this pussy up with my ejaculation will satisfy the deep desire in me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_052@Hilda's vagina tightens at my endless attack, as if she was unable to bear any more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_053@Ahh- it's too much... sobs...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_054@Hah... there's more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_055@The tightening of inside her pussy enhanced the elation of our movements.\nI held back the urge to pour myself into her and thrusted harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_056@The already hot and wet pussy sucks on to my cock, almost crippling my defenses.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_057@I rubbed Hilda's breasts that were pounding from the impact, mustering up my strength for the last few thrusts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_058@Ahh- it's too hot-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_059@I drove my hip forward harder in Hilda's cries. \nThe penis thrusts into the deepest part of her, gushing my steamy white semen and filling up the overstimulated pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_060@A young girl's sweet pussy has met a beastly intrusion, her scent mixed with the thick smell of sexual desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_061@I caressed Hilda who was still panting from the aftermath.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_062@Hilda did a great job... you really gave your best.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h1_063@player's cock... has become a special memory...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_001@This octopus plushie from player is so adorable~ \n reminds me of the octopus I used to see in the sea...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_002@I'm glad you like it, even though it's a prize from the lottery... \nBut cute things suit Hilda well indeed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_003@I will hug it to sleep tonight~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_004@Haha, you might dream of an octopus then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_005@At night, Hilda hugged her plushie as she fell asleep. \nAs time passed, she gradually furrowed her brows.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_006@That's strange... where is this... \nAm I in a dream?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_007@What a pretty cave... shiny like a diamond.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_008@So there's a lake here! \nSeems deep.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_009@But there seems to be some noise...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_010@Roar~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_011@Eek - so- so many tentacles!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_012@Hehe... Since you've come, shall I treat you to something great?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_013@The few tentacles from the lake grabbed onto Hilda's body and limbs. \nThe slimy tentacles tore off her clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_014@Yah~ No--
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_015@The smooth tentacles entangled Hilda's fair body, playing with her defenseless nipples. \nThe nipples grew hard under the tentacles' touch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_016@Huhu, you've got a good pair of jugs... sensitive too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_017@Sob... not there...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_018@Oh? Then what about your pussy? \nDon't tell me, are you wet already?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_019@I can't... move... Ahh- unh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_020@Sounds like you're enjoying it. \nWhy don't you get more comfortable?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_021@The tentacles tore off Hilda's panties, rubbing her in the bud and probing her at the opening slightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_022@The fluid that oozed out from the pink pussy mixed with the tentacles' slime.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_023@Ahh~ Hah... tentacles are so cold... Ahh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_024@Haha... Your body seems willling for a tentacle intrusion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_025@Unh- unh... My body feels empty- Ahh, why am I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_026@No hurry, we're just beginning. \nEnjoy your pussy being filled by tentacles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_027@Unsatisfied by mere probing at the opening, the tentacle entered daringly into the wet pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_028@Hilda's pussy gave off a heat that seemed to welcome the tentacle's invasion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_029@The tentacle passed through tight friction from the vaginal walls, accumulating an unimaginable excitement.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_030@The wet vaginal walls were stimulated by the strong suction from the tentacles suckers, making Hilda moan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_031@Unh unh- it- it's in... \nThe tentacle... is inside me...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_032@Seems like you're hungry, you're clenching onto the tentacle tightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_033@Hah... I can't stop... I- I want more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_034@If that's the case, I shall go all out. \nI'll gladly feed this hungry little pussy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_035@Eh- wait... ahh- The tentacle... grew bigger inside me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_036@Your pussy's tight on stimulation...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_037@The tentacle probed deep into the wet pussy, growing bigger in the tight vaginal tunnel.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_038@The sticky fluid from Hilda's pussy became the perfect lubricant for the tentacle to move in and out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_039@Listen to that erotic sound, you hear it too, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_040@I want the tentacles - move in deeper- hit me harder... ahh-
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_041@You're more trouble than I thought, then what about here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_042@This little lump makes you sensitive, right? \nYour pussy seem unable to resist it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_043@Unh ahhhh- not- not there...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_044@Hehe, you're feeling so good your words are incoherent. \nLet's give you some more then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_045@With lewd thrusting sounds, the tentacle attacks at Hilda's most sensitive area.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_046@The suckers on the tentacle suck onto the narrow vaginal walls, stimulating them further through friction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_047@Hilda has become utterly defenseless, immersed in the feeling of being filled up by the engorged tentacle.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_048@My pussy... so- so full... Ahh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_049@My mind's all confused... I want more tentacles... ahh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_050@Looks like this pussy is turning red from being fucked.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_051@The tentacles thrusted deep and hard into Hilda's pussy. \nThe glittering love fluids dripped from their copulation non-stop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_052@The tender flesh around the pussy became exposed from the impact, showing a red glow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_053@I didn't know you were so fond of tentacles, what a kinky girl, hah.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_054@Hah- hah... I'm not- Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_055@Your pussy disagrees.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_056@Let the tentacles stir hard in your pussy, everyone loves them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_057@Unh ahh~ It's it's too comfortable- hah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_058@The tentacle sped up its thrusts. \nMore fluid flowed from the pussy and erupted from the friction.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_059@Get ready for your first tentacular climax!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_060@What- unh ahh- it's too much- ahh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_061@Hilda couldn't help but climax in the middle of loud lewd noises of thrusting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_062@As the mixture of tentacle slime and body fluid stained Hilda's thighs and pussy, \nHilda rested her eyes, panting in the aftermath...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_063@The next morning, Hilda awoke from her sleep. \nShe felt that she was wet from the dream and panties were soaked through by body fluids.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_064@Yuck! Why did I have such a dream! It's all player's fault!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_h2_065@Hilda pouted and threw the octopus plushie against the wall. \nThe octopus' eyes seemed to gleam under the sunlight...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_001@This afternoon, Hilda was on her way back to the dormitory as she had finished her swim training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_002@She passed by a beautiful building that she sees everyday. \nEven though she was curious, she had never been inside.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_003@She decided to pluck up the courage to go in today...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_004@Wow... \nSo many people are gathered here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_005@Hilda carefully opened the door, apparently the people had their eyes fixed on the front.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_006@Well then, that's today's Goddess sermon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_007@Everyone can get their Holy water up front~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_008@Please take turn... \nHey hey, don't cut in line!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_009@Hmm? Isn't that player?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_010@Hilda stared curiously from the corner. \nSora discovered her nonetheless.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_011@Hi~ you're Hilda, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_012@Er- yep! Hello~ \nHow did you know my name?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_013@Hehe, I saw you a few days ago when I went to the dorm... \nplayer mentioned you, saying you were a talented new member~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_014@Hehe... I'm not all that great... \nMay I know what is this...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_015@Oh dear, I haven't introduced. \nI'm Sora, a nun who serves the Goddess.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_016@This is a church to spread the values of the Goddess~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_017@The Goddess' values... sounds interesting~! \nI've never seen such groups or building on my island before!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_018@Are you interested in joining the church? Let me tell you about the Goddess in detail~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_019@Alright~ thank you! \nBut is player alright on his own?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_020@Hilda asked confusedly, staring at player who was clumsily issuing out Holy water.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_021@It's okay~ \nplayer is a volunteer at the church, who serves the Goddess!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_022@Since he plans to serve the Goddess, he ought to go though certain trials~ \nLet's go! I'll show you around the second floor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_023@Okay! Thank you~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_1_024@Hilda was led to the second floor by the kind Sora. \nAll that was left was player who was surrounded by a group of believers...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_001@This afternoon, I was finally done with matters at hand. \nI was planning to relax my body by exercising on the field.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_002@When I was passing by the pool, I saw a shadow gracefully gliding in the water.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_003@Eh, so it's Hilda. \nI see you're practicing hard~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_004@player~ It's a great weather today, I'm especially tempted to swim a few extra laps.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_005@Hilda leaned at the side of the pool. \nWater droplets rolled down her fair cheeks, tracing a graceful arc.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_006@The seemingly shining Hilda seemed like a beautiful mermaid...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_007@Does player want to join me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_008@Haha, I don't turn out requests from pretty girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_009@I went back to my room to put on my swimming trunks, before returning to the pool.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_010@player, remember to warm up~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_011@We can have a match to see who swims faster. hehe.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_012@Alright... I accept your challenge, the loser has to buy ice cream!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_013@Hilda turned back to carry on swimming. \nI hurriedly began my warm up, jumping in the water in a matter of minutes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_014@The unexpected cold made me tremble. \nBut I didn't care.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_015@I didn't know player was this good at swimming~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_016@Hah, hah... Of course, I'm a coach after all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_017@Actually I was beginning to feel a little tired after some distance. \nBut I couldn't lose this fight with my pride on the line!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_018@I swam with all my might. \nThe cold water almost made me numb and I was losing strength in my legs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_019@My ankle twisted in pain all of a sudden...! The pain was so intense I couldn't move my legs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_020@Water poured in through my mouth and nose. \nI didn't even have time to panic.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_021@Puff- cough, cough!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_022@player what's wrong??
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_023@Before I submerged under the water, I saw Hilda swimming towards me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_024@She grabbed my arm and supported my head out of the water. \nHilda brought me back ashore to rest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_025@Feeling better?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_026@Hilda patted me worriedly . I was coughing non-stop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_027@Cough, cough... I'm- I'm fine, thank you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_028@player, you almost just drowned! \nDidn't I say you have to warm up properly?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_029@Seeing that I was feeling better, Hilda semed angry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_030@S- sorry, I'll take it more seriously next time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P039_N_2_031@Even though I got a scolding from Hilda, \nit was rare to see Hilda angry, the experience felt precious somehow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_1@It’s not strange for men to jerk themselves off when they’re in the mood.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_10@Under my astonished gaze, Saki crawls up my chair and sits on my.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_11@Saki, wait... You can't sit there right now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_12@Aaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_13@As expected, my shamelessly erect cock touches Saki’s soft pussy, making me gasp loudly in response.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_14@It's okay... Saki is willing to help you out, Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_15@Already in an excited state, I find myself unable to resist her now that she’s so proactive.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_16@... Saki, take off your panties.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_18@Saki listens to me obediently and puts my cock right against her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_19@Mmm.... Aahhhh...! Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_2@Tonight is such a night. I sit in front of my computer with all the items I need and play my favorite videos...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_20@It’s already wet. Was Saki secretly watching me jerk off?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_21@Hearing my teasing question, Saki’s face becomes a bright red.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_22@Sa...Saki wasn't watching...! It's just... I heard Coach from outside the door...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_23@That made you this excited? So Saki is a precocious little girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_24@*Sob* I know I was wrong...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_25@Saki starts crying because she doesn’t understand that I’m just teasing her. Saki is especially cute when she is like this. I caress her head gently to soothe her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_26@I’ll forgive you if you do your best to serve me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_28@Saki crouches on top of me and waggles her small ass as she rubs her pussy against my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_29@The tight and soft feel of her pussy is unique to a young maiden and the feeling of it rubbing against my cock is just too addictive. I can’t help taking the lead by increasing the speed of the rubbing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_3@Fully engaged in the movements in the screen, my hand moves faster and faster until I’m about to climax...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_30@Aaaahh... Coach... If you rub so hard... Saki will... Saki will...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_31@Saki trembles all over. Her tiny body is almost overcome by the sensation of the rubbing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_32@But... Saki isn't a child anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_33@Aaahhhh... Coach... Saki can't hold back anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_34@Saki pants while blushing and looks at me with her large cute eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_35@I want Coach's cock... I want it inside me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_36@How can I resist such a cute request from such a cute girl?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_37@But when I place my cock against her pussy and prepare to put it in, Saki stops me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_38@Saki will put it in herself...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_39@Are you sure? Don’t force yourself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_4@Coach...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_40@Saki can do it! Saki will serve Coach and make you feel good!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_41@Saki’s expression is really determined. I know that no one can stop her when she makes this expression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_42@Okay then. You can try to sit down slowly while relaxing your pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_43@From this position, I realize that Saki's body is really tiny, whereas my cock is quite thick and large. It might be forcing it a little to put it inside her?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_44@The moist and soft feeling of her pussy lips against my cock is so nice, and I can feel how tight her pussy is after my cock edges into her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_45@As Saki’s body sinks downwards, my cock drills its way into her tight entrance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_46@Aaahhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_47@My cock parts her pussy walls inch by inch until her tiny pussy swallows my whole cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_48@Hehe... I put all of it into me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_49@Saki smiles happily at me like she has achieved something amazing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_5@Saki’s shy face appears next to the door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_50@Saki is just too cute...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_51@Saki will do her best to make you feel good, Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_52@Saki hugs my neck and bounces up and down tentatively. Her pussy makes squishy noses as it slides against my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_53@Am I doing it right...? Saki... Tried to remember what Coach taught me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_54@Yes, you're doing very well, Saki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_55@Saki is so happy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_56@Saki smiles more happily after hearing my encouragement and bounces more vigorously on my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_57@Aahhh... This is so good... Coach... Do you feel good too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_58@Saki’s serious face becomes blank soon after she started riding my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_59@Her hips seem to have gone weak from the pleasure, but she doesn’t stop moving. Her desire for pleasure has already enslaved her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_6@Eh... Saki, wait...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_61@Her pussy becomes soft and sticky, and it feels like it would be amazing to fuck it hard right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_62@Desiring even more stimulation, I press onto Saki’s ass and start thrusting into her powerfully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_64@Saki has completely forgotten to serve me as she moans with her arms around my neck.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_65@Her tiny pussy that I was worrying about moments ago is now swallowing my giant cock with ease, and it clenches my cock tight as it slides in and out of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_66@Saki is just too cute and too erotic right now. I can’t suppress the urge to fuck her roughly and show her some love.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_67@Aaahhhh... Coach... Saki can't hold back anymore...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_68@Instead of slowing down after I hear her, I speed up instead.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_69@Showing me your expression while you climax is part of serving me... So cum for me, Saki!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_7@It's fine, Coach, Saki understands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_71@Saki moans loudly as she cums. A hot current bursts out of her pussy as her pussy clenches tight, which makes me cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_73@The impact of my cum gushing out inside her makes Saki cum again. She moans and collapses weakly on my shoulder where she pants.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_74@Did Saki do well...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_8@Saki speaks considerately before she... Walks into my room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P04_h3_9@S...Saki?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_001@Hmph hmph~ Time, venue, ingredients, everything is perfect!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_002@I must unleash the power of the Dark Abyss, to overcome my phobia!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_003@O Power of the Dark! Show yourself, and swallow everything!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_004@Buzz - 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_007@It can't be. Why isn't it responding?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_008@No, something must be wrong. I'll try again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_009@O Forbidden Power that lurks here! Let the slumbering darkness show before me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_013@Sigh. I had too much hope for the ritual after all... I should head back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_014@Alice!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_015@Woah! Coach?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_016@I knew you were up to something somewhere. \nI heard this used to be a mass grave. Aren't you afraid?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_017@The darker the atmosphere the more it's worth a try...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_018@Sigh... Clean up your voodoo equipment. \nI'll help you speed up the process.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_019@Tss...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_021@Coach, did you just hear something? \nIt feels like we're not alone...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_022@Hmm? Is there any noise?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_024@Right, I hear it now. \nBut it feels like it's coming from below the ground.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_025@Could it be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_026@Psst!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_027@Ahhhhh Coach! Th- There's a hand reaching out from the ground ahhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_028@Didn't you consider the consequences before you acted?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_029@Oh wells, hide behind me. Leave it all to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_030@Splash! Splash!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_031@Hah... Finally... I'm out...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_032@It- It's a zombie! \nOh no, I don't have any weapon on me, if she attacks...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_033@Zom...bie? Is that... referring to me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_034@My name... is Natasha... \nBut... I don't know... what a zombie is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_035@It seems like this girl still has her consciousness. \nShe seems nice enough too, maybe we could talk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_036@Nice to meet you, hi, I'm player, a squirt gun squad coach. \nThis is Alice, a member on my team.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_037@Squirt gun team... What is that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_038@You probably lived in a time when squirt gun teams weren't a thing yet. \nBut it's fine, it won't affect a thing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_039@Training usually starts from zero. You can join our team from today!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_040@Hold on?! Coach, are you serious?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_041@Of course I'm serious, or where do you expect her to stay? We don't even know if she'll be taken to become some research subject.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_042@We can give her a place to stay, while I get extra help on the team. \nHaven't you heard that zombies excel in physical qualities?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_043@Besides, this is your mess after all. You have to take care of her, got it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_045@What about it, Natasha? \nYou'll go through squirt gun training while I provide you with food and lodging. It's a good deal, isn't it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_046@Stay... with Mr player...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_047@Yes, you can say that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_048@Are we... family then?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_050@Err... in a way? \nBesides me and Alice, a lot of girls live there too. They'll all be your family too!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_051@A lot... family...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_052@Then... okay.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_1_053@This marks the first encounter with that zombie girl.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_001@This is Alice's distant cousin, Natasha. \nShe'll be living with us from now on. Treat her well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_002@Nice... to meet you all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_003@Wow~ your look is awesome! \nThis ought to be that... Goth Lolita style, right? My stylist told me about it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_004@I am Yui, it's nice to meet you too... ahh! Why is your hand so cold?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_005@Well... That's because Natasha fears the cold since she was born. That's why her hands are always cold. Right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_006@If that's the case, I ought to cook her hot soups and make her hot tea.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_007@Sigh, why must I be a part of this charade?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_008@Well, not everyone can accept living with the living dead, can they?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_009@To accomodate her with the modern world, we will bump into more problems in the future. We can't let our guard down.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_010@I underestimated the difficulty of the problems after all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_011@It's the best to play soccer in a good weather after all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_012@Take this - Killer Goal!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_013@Bump!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_014@Na- Natasha?! Are you okay? Are you injured?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_015@Hmm... I'm okay, thanks for your concern.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_016@But... Your whole arm looks dislocated and twisted in an impossible angle! \nAre- Are you really okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_017@Yes... It doesn't... hurt at all, so it's fine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_018@Hold on! I'll handle it! I'll call the hospital!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_019@We didn't send her to the hospital of course. \nBut relocating Natasha's arm took quite a lot of effort.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_020@Ahh, how nice, no wonder it's a remake of a classic.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_021@Having watched it with Nadeshiko, I also learned a lot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_022@May I know... what are you watching? It looks like a lot of people in a little box...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_023@Oh it's Natasha? We're watching a love story set in the nineteenth century~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_024@Nineteenth century...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_025@If we can open the little box and walk in... can I go back to my hometown...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_026@... Hometown?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_027@Hold on! If you unplug it like that, the TV will break!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_028@S- Sorry! \nThis is Natasha's special interest. Sometimes she gets carried away with acting...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_029@I'll take her away! \nSorry we disturbed your TV time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_030@Is Coach seeming weirder and weirder?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_031@Sorry, Mr player, I seem to cause you a lot of trouble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_032@No, I've just been too busy lately to take care of you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_033@I also thought your 'cousin' would spend more effort in coaching you to cope with life?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_034@Sob... Sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_035@Anyway, we will take it one day at a time. \nNatasha, if you run into something you don't understand, you must ask us first. Okay?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_036@Okay... I won't disturb you further, sorry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_037@Ahh! Hold on! Be careful with the door - 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_039@Ahhhhh Coach! Natasha's arm fell!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_2_040@I feel like my head is starting to hurt...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_001@This is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_002@I remember... It's the little attic in my old home.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_003@I used to be kept here for a long time. I didn't think I would be back again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_004@I never get hungry when I'm with Mr player, and I can't taste anything when the girls offer me food...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_005@Why am I hungry all of a sudden, and why can I smell food again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_006@It's the smell of roast chicken... It's light, but it's wafting through the door cracks... \nBut they won't give it to me, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_007@Well then... I can go buy it on my own! \nI have a little money left, as long as I crawl out that window...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_010@No... no... Father... I'm not trying to run away... I just...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_011@<color=#B22222>Ahhhhhh - </color>
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_012@Hah~ Genius Miyu has finally figured out a new pose to last me a few hundred rounds with Coach without getting tired!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_013@I can't believe it's already midnight. My brain cells need replenishing. I'll go look for food in the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_014@Hmm? What's that noise...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_015@Oh dear, isn't this Natasha? So you're a night owl too huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_016@Hold on, she doesn't look right...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_017@Roarrrr arghhhh - 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_019@Stop it! Don't bite me! I don't taste good at all! Help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_020@Clunk!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_021@You've met your match, nightcrawler.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_022@Growllll....
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_023@T- Thanks, Itsuki for saving me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_024@This is my mission, you need not thank me. We should leave her matter to the Young Master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_025@Garhhh!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_026@Ahh~~!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_027@Damn, she's strong. I may not be able to hold her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_028@Eh? A magical protection?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_029@Oh dear... Tonight is turning out to be fun.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_030@Devil-Sis is here too? I... How can I thank you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_031@You should know to respect me now. \nI do not require money, you can give me all your spiritual energy again. How about it~?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_032@Oh God! Please! Anything else!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_033@Don't yell too loudly, you don't want to wake everyone up, do you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_034@Then, before Master wakes up, we shall leave Natasha in your hands, Madam Grace.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_036@How did I go to sleep and wake up to this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_037@And she hasn't recovered her consciousness until now. Now we're out of an excuse...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_038@Master, might I ask what be your decision? \nSay the word and I'll finish her off with my knife.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_039@With a knife? Girl, do you know what you're talking about?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_040@When facing the undead, we obviously have to burn her to ashes to be thorough.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_041@No, all the more we should cleanse her with the Goddess' mercy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_042@I heard that aiming at the head had a great effect, hehe...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_043@All of you, hold it! \nThere must be another way, just give me a bit more time!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_044@Coach, are you sure you want to do this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_045@Her aggressive nature will put us all in danger.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_046@I know, but haven't we pulled through thick and thin because you believed in me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_047@I may be rash this one time, but please believe in me again!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_049@Sigh, alright then. After all, you've always been like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_050@The other girls seemed to want to say something, but they held their tongue after Akane has spoken.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_3_051@I think this is probably my only shot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_002@I'm here again... I can't escape after all?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_003@My hunger is back again... What should I do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_004@Clunk!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_005@Hmm... Why... is there a piece of meat here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_006@It's cold, but it's fresh. It's tempting enough for me who have starved for so long...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_007@I'm not sure what could replace what you crave the most, so I brought the next best thing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_008@You seem satisfied enough, I'm glad to see that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_009@This is... Mr player?! He's found me?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_010@But... His voice is so clear, yet I can't see him... Where is he?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_011@Unh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_012@Some memories seem to be resurfacing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_013@So this is not real, and I've done something awful again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_014@Would the people... hate me again? \nIthought this would be different...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_015@The way they're looking at me... It's the same way Father and Mother do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_016@I don't want... I really don't want to be in pain anymore...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_017@Natasha.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_018@Th- This warmth on my shoulder...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_019@I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm on your side.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_020@Grrr...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_021@Even if everyone thinks of you as a monster, I remember your pure, kind heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_022@I know you must not have wanted this, so I will stay here with you, and wait for you to come back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_023@I believe in you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_025@Someone like me... Can I really be trusted?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_026@Thank you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_029@Mr player's living room? This means...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_030@Coach, you did it! It's unbelievable!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_031@Those true of will can recall the pure of heart. Master, I learned another valuable lesson.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_032@We can't let down our guard. Who knows when she'll lose it again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_033@Relax, I'll take care of it. Everything will be fine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_035@Welcome back, Natasha.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_036@It's gonna take time for everyone to accept you, but we can get there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_038@Yeah, I'm back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_4_039@Back to... a new home where people are willing to accept me.'
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_020@Natasha nodded reluctantly and walked out of the changing room, but there was a little mishap after we've walked for a bit. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_022@Her ill-adjusted arms seemed to have made the knot on her bikini too loose, and her top fell off.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_023@Seeing her bend down to pick it up, I couldn't help but start to imagine how her breasts would look and feel to the touch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_024@Err... It's a little embarrassing... \nBut can Mr player put this back on for me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_025@Of course.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_026@Taking the bikini top, I suddenly decided to take the chance to tease her a little.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_033@You don't have to be shy. Or how about I do something to make you comfortable?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_034@Hmm? I'll leave it to you then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_035@Sensing that Natasha did not hate what I was doing, that she even started to be immersed in my caresses, I daringly massaged her ample breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_036@Besides the lack of warmth, the elasticity of her skin mimicked that of a normal girl. It was magical.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_037@Do you feel good now? Natasha?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_038@Y- Yes... But at my thighs... there seems to be something hard?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_039@Oh, that is mine. Boys have that, you know. \nYou can touch it if you want.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_040@I went for Natasha's curiosity. Her hand reached out towards my groin, and touched my bulging meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_041@This feeling... is so strange...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_042@But it is a part of my body. \nIf Natasha is willing to clutch it between your thighs, it will surely be an enjoyment for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_043@I- I'll try it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_044@Natasha's obedience exceeded my expectations. \nWhen my rod was clamped between her tender thighs, it felt as refreshing as plunging it in cold water.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_045@Ahh, that's it. Keep it up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_046@I held Natasha and moved my hips, so my meat rod slid back and forth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_047@Ahh~ This coolness is the best!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_048@Being able to help Mr player makes me happy too...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_049@Besides the stimulation from between the legs, Natasha's hands were busy too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_050@This made me massage her breasts more excitedly, pinching her beautiful nipples occasionally.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_051@Ahh... this light-headedness... I've never felt it before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_052@Then, let us enjoy is while it lasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_053@I sped up my movements, which made Natasha hold my cock more tightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_054@We no longer cared if we were in a public place. We were just focused on making each other more comfortable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_055@I'm about to cum...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_056@Cum? What... does that mean?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_057@You'll find out soon!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_058@At that moment, the white cum that signified the apex of joy squirted out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_060@The defenseless Natasha was stained all over with my cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_061@W- What is this? It's hot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_062@When guys feel really good, this comes out of them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_063@If we shot this inside a girl's body, we might make them pregnant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_064@When I explained that, Natasha put a finger dipped in cum into her mouth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_065@Hmm... It's a taste I like...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_066@She took the swimsuit from me to put it on. \nAfter the cum-baptism, she seemed to be more daring and no longer afraid of wearing revealing clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h1_067@Next time, when Mr player feels hot, you can come to me again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_001@When I was sound asleep, someone knocked on my door, waking me up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_002@Who is it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_003@I'm sorry to disturb, it's me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_004@It's Natasha? Come in.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_005@The fact that Natasha would come to me at this time of the night really peaked my interest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_006@What's the matter? Do you need help with something?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_007@I... had a bad dream...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_008@I dreamed that the home was gone... Everyone was gone, and so were you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_009@Ahh, is that so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_010@I signed for Natasha to come to the side of the bed, and hugged her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_011@No worries, the dorm is not going anywhere, and neither am I. \nI will never leave you alone.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_012@Hmm... It's nice to hear Mr player say that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_013@I didn't know zombies could have nightmares... Natasha seems to be becoming more and more alive.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_014@Alive? I don't understand...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_015@How should I put this? The fact that you're a zombie will never change,\nbut you always make me feel like someone with life.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_016@Shall we call it proof of your 'life'?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_018@Hmm? Did I say something wrong?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_019@No... \nOn the opposite, Mr player's words are always full of power, even though you might not realize it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_020@You're always giving me strength, even saving my rationality, \nbeing the first one who believed in me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_021@I have finally come to realize... you mean more to me than I imagined.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_022@Natasha started to take off her clothes. \nI was stunned, unable to believe what I was seeing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_023@I can't get pregnant anymore, but I want to be with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_024@At least I can do... what normal living humans can do...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_025@She took off the only coverage on my body, and bend down to hug me. \nThe adorable face and body made my little doppelganger stand erect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_026@But I couldn't say a word, still shocked at Natasha's boldness. \nHow long has she been hiding this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_027@Please let me... feel more of your warmth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_028@She held my already wet meat rod, and slowly pushed it into her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_029@Ahh... So this is... how it feels for it to come in... \nThis heat... feels like it's emanating from my body...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_030@Even though Natasha was cold throughout her body, her pitiful look filled me with an urge to give her all of my warmth.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_031@You've done enough. Let me satisfy you from now on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_032@I gave it all I've got, and pounded towards the deepest place inside Natasha.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_033@Ahh, ahh... I love it... Don't stop... ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_034@I felt Natasha's cold yet elastic vaginal walls suck tightly on my rod, every inch of her sending off a signal of carnal urge.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_035@This was further reflected on her actions. She moved forward and kissed me deeply.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_036@Hmm... unh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_037@The intertwining lips and tongues seemed to want to suck away all my warmth, encouraging our passion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_038@I knew that Natasha could take more than a normal human, so I pounded more fiercely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_039@Ahhhh~ That's it... It's great... I want more... Ahhh~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_040@Natasha couldn't help but give out pleasurable moans, seeking my kisses and touches more eagerly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_041@I thrusted hard at the opening of Natasha's uterus, also immersed in the thrill of the pounding.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_042@Hah... It feels like... I'm heating up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_043@Under my constant stimulation, Natasha met my movements more and more smoothly, and began to move her hips to gain more excitement.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_044@I've got my energy built up to a certain point by then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_045@Take this heat, Natasha!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_046@I yelled, and poured all my essence into Natasha's body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_047@Ahh unh... unh ahh -
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_048@Natasha who was in the midst of kisses couldn't help but let out a moan upon climax.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_049@Later, she sat up and panted, pulling out a string of saliva between our lips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_h2_050@Ahh... I can finally... store your heat in me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_001@On a sunny day, I arranged a field exercise for a few girls, and Natasha was one of them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_002@The day was hot, so everyone had on swimsuits.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_003@Natasha was the only one who hasn't come out of the changing room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_004@Hmm? Has anyof you seen Natasha?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_005@Yeah, she was still inside before I got here. She seemed troubled, looking at her swimsuit.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_006@We asked if she needed help, but she shook her head and said she could do it herself, before pushing us out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_007@It's fine. You guys stay here. I'll look for her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_008@I walked to the changing room, and knocked politely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_009@Natasha, are you in there?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_011@What's the matter? The girls told me you were still here. Did you run into some trouble?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_012@Well... Actually it's nothing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_013@It's just... the first time I'm wearing clothes with such little material... I don't feel at ease...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_014@Right, I forgot that Natasha was born in a more conservative time...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_015@Besides... my body... doesn't look... as good as... the human girls...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_016@Natasha walked out to the door and looked at me. \nIndeed, without the coverage of daily clothes, her wounds and stitches were in plain sight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_017@I felt a little ashamed for not giving this more thought when I arranged the lesson.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_018@You needn't worry about that. You look great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_019@Everyone must think so too. Don't be nervous, I'll go over with you. You'll get used to the swimsuit after you've spent some time with them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_020@Natasha nodded reluctantly, when she finally mustered up the courage to step out of the changing room, her expression still fearful.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_021@I ought to do something to distract her... \nI had an inspiration.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_022@Ahh, it's hot today... I wish there was a way we can relieve ourselves of the heat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_023@I... I have very little idea about temperature. What does Mr player have in mind?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_024@Actually, just off the top of my head, the fastest way would be - 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_025@I hugged Natasha from behind. \nJust as I expected, the cold of the dead alleviated the heat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_026@It's comfortable to hug Natasha on a hot day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_027@Thank you... But... I'm a little embarrassed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_028@You don't have to be. Just relax a little and you can find the joy in things.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_029@I let go of Natasha and patted her on the back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_030@What do you think? Aren't you less nervous now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_031@I''m getting used to wearing these clothes outdoors now... Thank you Mr player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_032@No worries. Go look for the rest. I'll treat you girls to ice cream when we're done with training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_033@Natasha nodded, walked a few steps and came back as if she thought of something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_1_034@Oh right, whenever Mr player feels hot... you can always... hug me again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_001@I feel like I'm getting used to my new home...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_002@But that is why, I'm starting to understand what a 'zombie' is.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_003@My body is dead, but I can still move around like a normal person...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_004@So... Am I dead or alive?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_005@Ahh! It's Sis Natasha!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_007@Eh? Can Sis see me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_008@Yes... I can see you, Miss Ghost.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_009@Eh hehe... You can just call me Berry~ Nice to meet you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_010@After all zombies can see each other~ \nMaybe because we're all the same... Both dead and alive?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_011@Hmm, it feels weird to say that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_012@I was actually getting confused about that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_013@Like you... Ghosts and zombies seem to differ from humans in terms of species.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_014@But we do what humans do, don't we? \nSo... what are we?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_015@Ahh, how would I know~ \nI've never thought of these things before~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_016@Is that so... I envy you for not overthinking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_017@Hmm~ Living a happy life is more important to me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_018@And Mr player is good to everybody. He's a nice, dependable man, whom I can rely on with everything!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_019@Mr player? He is different from everyone I know...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_020@I lost my warmth, but he gave it to me again. \nI heard that was how he made me regain my consciousness too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_021@Really? That's great!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_022@Miracles are happening to Sis Natasha. I'm happy for you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_023@I remember getting the ability to materialize because I really wanted to hug Coach~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_024@Tada~ Like this!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_025@Un- Unbelievable...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_026@Yeah, that's why I feel, Mr player gave us the key to miracles.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_027@This is also proof of us 'living'!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_028@He made us special, huh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_029@I... seem to understand now. Thank you, Berry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P040_N_2_030@Hehe~ It's nice to meet Sis Natasha! \nCome play with me anytime!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_001@Crunch... crunch... (Munching)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_002@Ahh, what a beautiful time. No stressful Christmas quota to hit nor squirt gun competitions that I can't seem to beat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_003@It's actually pretty nice staying at Coach's dorm, being able to munch on chips while watching the TV — it's just the best~ munch...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_004@I heard that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_005@Eek!! \nCoach... Isn't it beautiful weather out today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_006@No. \nI wanted to recruit a few others to join the training while we're free, but we didn't get any registrations. Are we losing our appeal...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_007@So pranksters like you have troubles too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_008@A coach's troubles may be more than you can imagine. \nWhat are you watching, anyway... period drama? How unexpected of you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_009@Eh... I don't know. I've never seen shows like this at Old Man Claus', so I got curious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_010@I see. I think warriors are cool too. \nIf we had a warrior on our squad, we'd win half the battle with simply our aura, don't you think? It must be great! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_011@...Oh dear, did I waste one and a half hours outside the office?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_012@I'll stop chatting for now. I need to check for new resumes. See ya~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_014@Oh right, I still haven't given Coach his Christmas present last year... \nHe said there was no hurry, but ended up forgetting all about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_015@I can do him a favor then! If such be his wish~ Hehe!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_016@(A few days later)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_017@There are three resumes today? Let me see...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_018@This one's too ordinary, no... This one probably doesn't have enough stamina, also no...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_019@The third one... Hmm? The photo shows a beauty~ I wonder what the info looks like.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_020@The name is Haruko huh... \nHold on... Place and date of birth are blank? Is she messing with me?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_021@Warrior for her occupation... huh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_022@I think warriors are cool too. \nIf we had a warrior on our squad, we'd win half the battle with simply our aura, don't you think? It must be great! 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_023@Don't tell me this was Miyuki granting my wish... \nI should issue an invitation first. I hope she will be easy to get along with.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_024@(Day of interview)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_025@Hello, please introduece yourself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_026@Yes. My name is Haruko and the way of the warrior is my path. I am at your service.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_027@...How very serious of you. \nWell, suit yourself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_028@But your apparel is a little different than I imagined. \nI thought you would wear proper warrior armor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_029@Such was the way I dressed, until I arrive at this foreign land. The one who took me in told me I should adapt to the current times.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_030@This is the current style? Why do I feel you're going a little bit too advanced...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_031@Then, may I know why you wish to join our squad?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_032@I wish to strengthen myself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_034@Your great name has reached me of late, and I was impressed by your commanding skills. You seem worthy enough to follow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_035@I wish to take over the world with you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_036@Taking over the world... seems a little overboard... We do plan to aim for first in the world... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_037@But it's good to have such ambition. \nNow let me see you shine. You should know something like the Iaidō, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_038@Yes. I shall do my best.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_039@Slash!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_040@Wow!! That cool draw!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_041@And that righteous expression, standard and natural pose... \nA common imitator wouldn't be able to do that!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_042@If we let her join, I can imagine my squad looking majestic, I would look so cool on the streets~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_043@Was that alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_044@Ahh... Of course! Sorry I was in a daze. 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_045@You have fully proven your worth and will. Congratulations on getting recruited.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_046@!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_047@Thank you for your appreciation. \nFrom now on, you are my Master. I shall give my all to fight for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_048@I will continue to work hard, so that I can earn the right to serve you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_049@Ugh, I'm still not used to talking to someone so serious...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_050@But we better do this her way. That should be easier for her, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_1_051@Then, I'll rely on you from now on, Miss Haruko.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_001@Saku, have you heard? That player recruited another rookie.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_002@I know, I think it's some warrior-sister. I saw her come out from her room, but I was too afraid to talk to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_003@What are you afraid for? She could be full of it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_004@Take me to see which room she's in. Two of us should be brave enough right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_005@Eh heh... Mizuki is so considerate.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_006@Hmm? The door is open...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_008@Excuse me, is...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_010@Hey, warrior-mania, we're calling you, can't you hear?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_012@What do we do? She's not moving, and she's ignoring us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_013@I think, she might be meditating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_014@Miss Oboro?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_015@Ninjas and warriors are different in nature, \nBut we are loyal to our Masters, and we value our training.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_016@Practicing not to be disturbed by our surroundings is part of the process.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_018@Tsk, looks like we picked a bad time. \nI don't get why they do all this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_019@Mizuki, don't be like that. Since we all live together, we should respect everyone's lifestyle choices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_020@It's rare that you're not being stupid today. Forget it, let's go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_021@Meowoo~ I miss my night with player~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_022@I'll go rub his bed tonight too, Me-hehe...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_023@Slash!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_024@Meow-arghh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_025@Please stop, and only enter for matters of importance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_026@Why? player has never rejected Luna's visit meow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_027@Master is exhausted from his daily troubles. I must defend his quality of sleep.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_028@Before Master wakes up naturally, I shan't allow any disturbance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_029@Sob... That's too much meow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_030@Coach, have you eaten? I'll deliver your dinner directly?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_031@Please do not disturb the busy Master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_032@But, I was hoping he could take some time for eating...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_033@Any extra dialogue or movements may cause emotional burden to Master, and affect his efficiency.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_034@This is all for Master's wellbeing, so please go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_035@Why is that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_036@It's so upsetting. Who does she think she is?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_037@She thinks she's all that because she is a private guard? I can't believe Coach is allowing this arrogance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_038@Looks like we have to teach her a lesson so she understands how things work here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_039@Hold on! What are you discussing? What are you getting so worked up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_040@player? Why is that warrior-lover not with you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_041@The seasons have been changing and she seemed to have caught a cold. I asked her to rest for a few days. What's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_2_042@Err, actually...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_001@So, that's what's been happening lately.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_002@No wonder I feel like everyone's been acting weird. I felt so distant from all of you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_003@This can't go on, moron. You can't always do as she says.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_004@Yeah, or she'll just get more and more over the line, and disappoint more people for not being able to hear what you think.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_005@That's not what you wish to see, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_006@I understand. Thank you for telling me something so important, I will talk to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_007@(A few days later...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_008@I have been careless with my condition, such that I have not been able to care for Master's safety. \nI am sorry about this dereliction of duty.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_009@Don't mind it, I was planning to talk to you anyway.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_010@Please speak.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_011@To be frank, your attempt to uphold my personal safety has caused trouble for many people.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_012@May I know why? I do not understand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_013@Well... I do think it's important for the girls to retain their interests, so I didn't stop you from becoming my personal guard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_014@But, in fact, you are still my squad member, an equal to the rest of the girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_015@They would want to be around me in their own way, but you have blocked them out.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_016@You are going to become partners, represent me in competitions. If you don't get along, I will be troubled too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_018@I see. Is that the case?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_019@I have mislooked such an important part...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_020@What is it? Was I too serious?  If so I apologize!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_021@No, this is my problem.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_022@The so-called Warrior Spirit should include 'valuing the thinking of others, and respecting them'.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_023@When we face different people and things, we need to think from the perspectives of others, to reach the Zanshin state.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_024@But I was so obsessed with protection on the surface level, that I overlooked your emotions, and the welfare of the people who were supposed to be my partners.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_025@As a warrior, I have much more to learn. \nYou can even say... I lost my pride and right to be a warrior.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_026@I disagree.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_027@Why do you say so?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_028@During this time, Miss Haruko has been so dedicated to chasing after your goals. I deeply admire that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_029@Keeping your promises, strengthening your resolve — you have both of these requirements to be a warrior. \nYou just have to adjust your mindset a little.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_030@As long as you keep up this sincerity for others, I trust you';; be fine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_031@Sincerity huh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_032@Thank you for your kind reminder — I should adjust my mindset.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_033@If Master values everyone who lives with you, I should include all of them under my protection.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_034@I should also try to feel the heart that goes into every action... \nI have much to learn indeed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_035@To follow someone as admirable as Master, is my greatest honor!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_036@You think too highly of me. As a Coach, I don't know everything, I just meddle in a lot of conflicts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_037@I trust that every one of our members has good nature, and that I just have to understand what they think, and find the place for them to shine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_038@This should go hand in hand with the Zanshin you talk about, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_039@I see... \nYour words today have benefitted me greatly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_040@If it is possible, could you tell me more about the other members?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_041@Of course, the more you understand them, the more it should help you. \nI'll talk to you when I'm free, and introduce everyone to you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_3_042@Thank you. I will be sure not to disappoint you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_001@(On competition day...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_002@Damn it, the opponents are too strong. It's hard to break through...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_003@Oh no! Here they come! Rina, watch out —
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_004@Ahhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_005@Splash— Slash—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_006@The waves... were blocked?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_007@Are you alright, Miss Rina? \nLeave this to me, and go assist in other areas!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_008@A- Alright! Thank you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_010@Weren't we just at a disadvantage? Why is the situation looking so good now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_011@Miss Oboro, circle from behind the back of that one, we'll surround them!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_012@Understood.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_013@Hold on! When... Ahhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_014@... We won? Is it for real?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_015@(After the competition, squad resting area)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_016@Congrats, Haruko! You were the MVP, not bad!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_017@Thank you, I have much room for improvement, and your kind instructions are still most required.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_018@I still can't agree with those moronic acts before, but warrior-mania was quite reliable this time round.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_019@I can't deny she's really got what it takes, and I'm grateful that she helped me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_020@But I shan't let her hog the spotlight next time, or it's too embarrassing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_021@I had great cooperation with Haruko this time, it was really memorable. I hope I get to work with her next time too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_022@Thank you Haruko, you saved the game!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_023@No, I am not as good as you say...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_024@Hmm? What is that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_025@Sorry, Master seems to be calling me, I shall take my leave now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_026@What do you think? How does it feel to be the center of attention?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_027@I am not used to it, but they are all warm-hearted people as Master tells me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_028@This is all because you have tutored me on the information. \nTo be able to be of help to Master and your team, I am greatly honored.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_029@Like I said, you would be fine. \nYou have a pure and strong heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_030@Actually, I have always admired my warrior seniors.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_031@They deeply value conviction, promise, and every bond. They treasure them and tread a determined path with no regrets.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_032@To carry that spirit through my path to the same extent as they do, is the reason why I work so hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_033@Now, I feel even closer to my goal.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_034@That sounds great. \nThis may sound like a joke, but with you, we really might conquer the world.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_035@This is what I wish for as well.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_036@Oh right, there is the award ceremony later, are you willing to go onstage with me? \nIf you could perform another cool sword draw, that would be even better.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_037@I shall do so if it is Master's wish.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_038@Hehe~ Looks like everything is going well!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_039@I fulfilled another one of Coach's wishes~ \nI should be able to rest for... a long time without worrying about quotas to hit or team power, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_4_040@Before that, I shall enjoy my rest for a while~ (Munch)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_001@As Haruko required some help with carrying things from her former home to the dorm, I went to her place.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_002@What an exotic little place.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_003@Ah, Master, you are here. \nI am deeply sorry for not being able to play better host to you today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_004@No worries, I came to help. You're having a hard day moving, don't mind it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_005@But, I didn't expect most of your things to be in traditional Japanese style.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_006@They are of ancient history, just like the teachings of a warrior. They are precious legacy that I wish to treasure and pass on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_007@I have thought to part with a few of them, but I just could not bring myself to it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_008@This has Miss Haruko's style very much. Bring as many as you'd like. Your room will be decorated in a very special manner.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_009@As we chatted and put ourselves to work, we loaded all the boxes onto the truck.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_010@Ahh... I'm a little tired.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_011@If you don't mind, Master, there is an empty room in the house. Would you like to take a rest there?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_012@Okay, we have time anyway, let's do that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_013@As the room in Haruko's home was also a Japanese-styled room, I laid the mattress on the tatami, and climbed under the comfortable sheets.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_014@Hmm...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_015@There seemed to be some kind of tender texture beside me, that made me open my eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_017@Haruko has chosen to sleep directly beside me, her breathing close enough to hear.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_018@... Miss Haruko?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_020@Sorry, I did not mean to startle you. I merely felt that I should serve by your side, and yet I am wearied out by chores today...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_021@Don't worry, I think this is great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_022@Our eyes match. Her eyes were filled will shyness, but she wouldn't avert them. \nShe seemed like a girl more than any other time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_023@Miss Haruko has said that you will fulfill all of my desires, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_024@Yes, I have indeed said that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_025@That makes you the most loyal person on my team, doesn't it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_026@I said, while I reached my hand subtly under Haruko's top.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_027@Ahh... This is... necessary... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_028@I felt Haruko's tender skin, fumbling with her nipples at times.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_029@Haruko's soft moans, so different from her usual self, made me addicted.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_030@Does it feel good?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_031@Yes... \nMaster's touches... make me feel of use... so they feel good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_032@Then, it's your turn to make me feel good too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_033@I pulled down my pants, freeing my eager meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_034@Haruko seemed to have understood something as soon as she saw it. She closed her eyes, as if she has made a decision.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_035@... At your command, Master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_036@Haruko removed her top, baring herself to face me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_037@She looked at me with a shy smile. \nI felt a few droplets of sweet dew fall onto my thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_038@I shall do my best to make Master feel good.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_039@I held her leg, could not help pinching her buttocks as I grazed it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_040@Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_041@Steady now, a warrior wouldn't lose her composure so easily, would she?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_042@I readied my erect meat rod, grazing the tip carelessly at Haruko's wet opening.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_043@Ahh... There... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_044@Haruko looked slightly tormented. \nI know she wants to make me comfortable, but she was troubled by my lack of progress. But I just wanted to enjoy her expressions a little bit more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_045@Be patient, I'm coming now, aren't I?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_046@After I have had my fun, I slid my rod right into the heart of the slit, with a gloated expression.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_047@Ugh mmm!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_048@As though affected by my words, Haruko restrained her yell and simply made a silent moan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_049@I'll leave things to you then~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_050@I maintained my pose gracefully, as Haruko steadily and rhythmically moved her hips. \nHer two fair breasts jumped in spirits.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_051@With the rhythmic movements, the rod thrusted a little deeper each time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_052@Not bad, that's it, carry on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_053@Haruko had a difficult expression. I felt there was something wrong, but the warm and tight pussy left me no room to think.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_054@Is- Is this good enough... Master?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_055@Why would it not be? If only it were quicker.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_056@I pinched Haruko's round buttocks, \nAs though the urge worked, Haruko sped up her movements.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_057@As though to make it easier to move, she lay her upper body even lower. \nHer serious eyes were adorable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_058@Hmm... Unh mmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_059@But something does seem amiss, why is that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_060@That thought distracted me from controlling my urges. I squirted a pile of white cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_061@Ahh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_062@Feeling the hot liquid fill her up, Haruko trembled and screamed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_063@Thanks to the scream though, I finally understood the incongruity I felt just now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_064@Thank you, Miss Haruko, that was really remarkable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_065@As long as Master is pleased... it's enough...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_066@It was a pity how late I realized it. I watched my little doppelganger shrink down in size in the white cum... I can only wait for the next chance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_067@I thought of an excuse to extend this lovely time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h1_068@Ahh, it's so comfortable I don't want to get up. Let's sleep for a while more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_001@Ever since I noticed a problem with Haruko from the last time, \nI have been waiting for a chance to talk to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_002@When she told me her room decor was done, and invited me over, I finally had an excuse.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_003@This wall is really pretty. It's very you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_004@Thank you for your praise, Master. Being able to spread the ways of the warrior here and to be affirmed, is worth more to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_005@Something has been bugging me, by the way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_006@Bugged you? Have I done something to trouble you, Master?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_007@I'm not troubled, I just wanted to see how you were feeling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_008@How I... was feeling?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_009@I realized, when we were doing it the last time, that you were just too serious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_010@You were dedicated to making me feel good, and I felt how hard you worked, \nbut you seemed to have thought of making me feel good as a mission.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_011@That...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_012@Not enjoying yourself when you ought to be — that is not right.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_013@Then, what might be the way as Master sees fit? Please instruct me on the right way to go about things.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_014@Alright, we're halfway to success with the will to change. \nFrom now on, follow my instructions carefully.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_015@Yes, Master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_016@First of all, relax your mind and body. Just like when you meditate. \nThat shouldn't be hard, should it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_017@No problem, Master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_018@Then, imagine a pillar of water rushing towards you, but you don't have to resist it, you just have to experience that freshness.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_019@Focus on the body and the heart, and you will feel it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_020@Understood, Master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_021@So, what I'm about to do next is the same. \nYou can treat me as that pillar of water.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_022@I pushed Haruko onto the bed, as she looked at me with surprise.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_023@She still had doubts about my actions, but with my instructions earlier, she already relished all desires to stop me. I proceeded to remove piece by piece of her clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_024@Master... You...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_025@Facing things truthfully, should be one of the warrior teachings, is it not?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_026@Ahh... Yes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_027@Then you ought to remember this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_028@I put my bulging meat rod at the opening of Haruko's pussy, fondling the little clitoris occasionally.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_029@Hah... Mmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_030@You don't have to hold back, just feel it all. \nYou don't have to check if I'm feeling good, but ask your heart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_031@I looked straight at Haruko's blushing face. Even though she tried to pretend to be fine, but her unfocused eues and furrowed brows still expressed her daze.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_032@Do you like how it feels now?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_033@Hnh... Yes... I like it very much...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_034@That's it, as long as you like it, then all your confusion is unnecessary.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_035@Don't forget your heart that I kept mentioning just now. Come on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_036@As the pussy filled with juices from my massages, I stood my meat rod up, and watch as her tender hole swallow it up in one go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_037@Ahh... Master's... There... It's still so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_038@Under my constant persuasion, Haruko finally expressed herself without any pretence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_039@That's right, that's how it should be, immerse yourself in it completely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_040@I kept up the encouragement, as I moved my body and started thrusting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_041@Mmm ahh... Ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_042@Haruko received my constant stimulation at her lower body, \nher moans natural and delightful. I could feel that she was letting go of her reservations.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_043@I decided to let go too, grabbing both her legs and lifting her lower body, to ease my thrusting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_044@Ahh— Unh ahh— It's thrusting... deeper inside me... Hah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_045@I drove myself to the end again and again, causing Haruko to tremble. Her body grew tender as she grew weak.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_046@My greed for more of her lustful sounds made me speed up my advances. Haruko satisfied my desire and moaned constantly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_047@I admired her graceful form, her fair breasts that bumped violently with my movements, and her alluring, lustful expression. They all helped my excitement grow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_048@Our skin collided more rapidly, the lewd juices foaming at the point of our copulation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_049@Hnh! I'm cumming—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_050@After a brief tingle, my cum shot out in a burst.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_051@Ahhhh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_052@With a scream never heard before from Haruko, her love juices squirted like a fountain.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_053@When the squirting has come to a rest, all that was left was our panting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_054@Hah... Not a cold pillar of water... But steamy hot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_055@Looks like you successfully enjoyed it, Miss Haruko.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_056@After I said so, she shook her head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_057@Please... call me Haruko...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_h2_058@Maybe, when she's had a chance to change her perspective a few more times, \nI can see different sides of her, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_001@I do not understand why I have to perform the sword draw, but since it is Master's wish, it seems a fine decision to try.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_002@What has Master said to you, Haruko?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_003@Ahh! Miss Oboro?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_004@Nothing, I just saw your smile when you got back, as though you had something good happen to you, so I got curious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_005@We just talked on matters and mentioned the award ceremony.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_006@Also, I thanked him for his advice on my social relations.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_007@I see, that does sound like him.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_008@No wonder I feel like you have become much more easygoing. So this is indeed his teaching.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_009@Master says he has mediated in many fights. Form your reaction, I gather that is the truth?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_010@Yes. I too received advice from Coach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_011@I sought senpai's footsteps when I first came. When I saw that senpai has changed for Master, I had deep misunderstandings about both of them.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_012@I believed that senpai has begun to slacken, that she had forgotten a ninja's mission, almost fighting with her several times, only to be prevented by Master.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_013@That is why senpai had a chance to speak with me, to clear up the misunderstanding.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_014@Is that not good?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_015@It is. That is why you reminded me so much of the old me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_016@I had such bad attitude, but everyone welcomed me so warmly that I was a little overwhelmed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_017@Master was the first to care for me at the time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_018@You seem to be the disciplined kind like me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_019@Of course, we have also affected others. That is why I find you endearing,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_020@If we are not stricter on ourselves, we can hardly finish our missions. That is how I was taught.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_021@Seeing senpai look so happy and used to everyone's warm regard, I began to comprehend that such life was good.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_022@I believe so too. I only require more time to adapt.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_023@I understand. \nAdapting to the environment or enhancing your abilities — they take time and experience.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_024@I should be able to help you there. \nIf you run into any trouble, you can discuss with me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_025@Thank you, Miss Oboro, I shall not disappoint you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_026@Oh, here you are.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_027@Sen- Senpai?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_028@Nice to make your acquaintance, Miss Itsuki.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_029@Seems like Oboro finally found a new friend. She even took the initiative — I am so happy for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_030@What are you saying! If not because I was on the same team as Haruko, I may not have had a chance to speak to her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_031@Don't be shy, do we not all share the burden of Master's safety?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_032@Senpai is right. Let us work together from now on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_1_033@Yes, I look forward to it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_002@The scenery, perspective and colors — everything ought to be right...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_003@Excuse me, you seem troubled. Do you require assistance?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_004@Oh dear, aren't you the little sister who just made the team?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_005@It's nothing really, I just feel this piece lacks a little something, but I just can't tell.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_006@I have almost completed it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_007@May I know... What was your motivation for creating this piece?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_008@Oh, are you interested in that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_009@It's just an impromptu practice piece, not to be sold nor entered in a contest. That frees me up to try different ways of painting.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_010@If that is the case, would Miss Kagura mind if I attempted a few brushes?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_011@Hmm? Of course you can~ \nHave at it, and don't be concerned with the outcome, just have fun.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_012@I understand, thank you for your generosity. \nThen I am about to start.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_013@Oh? This familiar way of grinding the ink...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_014@And this strength and demeanor in the brushes... Wow!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_015@I am done. Miss Kagura, I await your comment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_016@I didn't expect you to just write a poem on it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_017@Not only do the rhymes and alliterations match, they fit the picture perfectly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_018@Little Sis, when have you learned to write prose and calligraphy?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_019@As a warrior with holistic pursuits, this is a must. \nAlso, you may refer to me as Haruko.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_020@Mhmm~ You may not dress like a warrior, but your spirit has certainly reached my canvas~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_021@Before this, I had never thought to write a prose on my drawings. I never thought the effect will be so good.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_022@To be able to help you from your troubles is my honor.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_023@In a way, this is a product of our making. \nWould Haruko like to name it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_024@What? Me?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_025@Why not? I used to name all my paintings, it would be a bore to deprive you of a chance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_026@Your poem gave me a new perspective. I should like to know what ideas you have for naming,
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_027@Please allow me to think.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_029@The word 'Bond', to signify all affinity and harmony between people. \nWhat does Miss Kagura think?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_030@That's quite interesting~ That will do~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_031@I quite admire you, Haruko, have a few drinks with me later! \nI know of a good Izakaya nearby~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P041_N_2_032@Alright, I rarely drink, but I can indulge just a little. \nI will rely on Miss Kagura to lead the way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_001@A really famous restaurant opened near the dorm recently. \nWith its Top Chef's Competition Grand Prix title, the restaurant has been flooded with crowds.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_002@To keep up with the trends, I brought along the equally interested Kana to have a taste.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_003@Coach is amazing~~ I can't believe you managed to book a place~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_004@Hah— it's all thanks to Kagano. \nIf it weren't for her connections, we'd have to queue for a year before we get a spot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_005@But I didn't know Kana would be interested in such cuisine!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_006@Hmm~ I thought it would be nice if I could come up with special ideas to cook for the girls, so I came for inspirations~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_007@You're so thoughtful! \nEh... this tastes amazing! Kana, quick, try it out!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_008@I thought this place was all about the publicity, I didn't expect it to be this good!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_009@The thin glaze of oil on the perfectly cooked beef, a balance of moisture and tenderness... \nIt's as if I am enjoying a feast for the soul at the opera!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_010@Hmm, mmm! It's delicious! \nThe broth is thick and yet not overly dependent on the spices!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_011@Kana, I've never asked anything of you... \nBut this is different...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_012@These dishes — can you replicate them?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_013@Hmm... I can't be a hundred-percent accurate, but I think I can give it a go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_014@That's great~ \nI don't have to come here to enjoy premium cuisine~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_015@Oh? Such insolence. Am I to understand a challenge is being issued?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_016@Just when I was about to gobble down another piece of beef, I saw a girl standing next to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_017@Eh? And you are...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_018@Me! I am the chef of this restaurant — Aurora! \nI accept your challenge!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_019@Pfft — What?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_020@Stop your pretense! I heard what you said! \nWeaklings who don't know their place, you'll be sorry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_021@Hold on, this challenge nonsense...\nI don't even know how to cook!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_022@You don't, but she does, doesn't she? \nAnd you call yourself a man? Are you gonna eat your words?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_023@Err... When did I say anything?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_024@C- Coach, what do we do...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_025@The girl who called herself chef glared straight at us.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_026@While I tried to make sense of the mess, \na thought came to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_027@I accept your challenge, so you can't back out! \nAs a chef, I choose her to be my challenger in this grand cooking face-off!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_028@I don't really understand how it got here... \nBut since trouble came looking, we ought to face it upfront.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_029@Okay! Kana will challenge you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_030@Eh, eh—?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_031@— With conditions though:\nThe date, venue, dish, and judge will be decided by us!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_032@Hah? Stop kidding! \nYou think I'm dumb enough to agree to such an unfair match?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_033@Oh? You're scared? Well then, I'll take Kana away.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_034@Hold on, stop! \nWhat do I have to fear? Let's do it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_035@Also, the loser owes the winner a wish!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_036@Make it so, hehe, we shall see!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_1_037@Hah... How did it come to this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_001@After agreeing to that ridiculous match, I apologized to Kana.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_002@Kana... sorry I said yes to the match.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_003@It's okay, I trust that Coach must have had other concerns. \nI will give my all to help!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_004@But... Aurora is a professional chef, how can we compete with her?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_005@Well... we have so many manpower on the team, it's time we put them to use.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_006@Although Aurora is a professional chef, everyone has their weaknesses. \nAs long as we find it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_007@Soon, the day of the match came. We used Kagano's family shop for the venue. \nAs for the judges... They are all girls from the squad.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_008@Oh, you're right on time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_009@Hmph, arriving on time is rule number one for a professional chef.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_010@I'll introduce the judges today. \nThis is Nadeshiko, Akane, and Yui.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_011@Miss Aurora, I'll be brief with the rules: \nThe cooking time is 2 hours, you can use all the pots and food materials.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_012@And the dish we're making today...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_013@You are making — a heartwarming home dish.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_014@Hah— What the hell is that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_015@What, you agreed that we'll decide. \nIf you feel like you can't do it, you can always give up~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_016@According to information collected from the members: \nAurora has always seen becoming the world's top chef as her goal, using top food materials and utensils to create cuisine of the highest quality.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_017@But a common home-cooked dish seemed to be beneath Aurora. \nThat was my strategy — hit the enemy in their blind spot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_018@Besides, the judges are all our allies. \nThis may be a little unfair, but you came looking for trouble!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_019@Hah! I'll be the one to win anyway!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_020@If Kana and Miss Aurora are fine, then — let the match begin!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_021@Does Kana need any help?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_022@Yup! I'm fine! \nFor the match, I've made modifications to the dishes~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_023@I trust you've got it, just stay levelled as usual!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_024@Aurora's precise knife work was breathtaking. \nHer body and hands moved in perfect harmony, as though she was dancing with the food.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_025@She glared at the bloody meat with a terrifying solemnity, as though the meat was her nemesis.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_026@The meat was sizzling in the pan. \nAurora held the pan in one hand, and a spatula in the other, flipping the beef in the flames. It was quite a sight to see.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_027@So this is what a professional chef looks like... \nHeh, but Kana won't lose!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_028@Kana was smiling and humming, adding spices to her cooking. \nThe soft fragrance and colors of her cooking had a healing effect.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_029@Well then, that marks the end of the cooking time. \nPlease plate your cooking and await the judge's ruling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_030@Wow~ Kana made a new dish~ \nThe red carrots were cut into the shape of bunnies, how cute! I'm gonna take a picture and upload it~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_031@Kana added fresh fruit in the dish. \nThere is a soft sweet scent that is well-complemented with rice.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_032@Hehe~ I thought a little change might make these dishes more flavorful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_033@Hmph, it's just a common dish.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_034@We shall taste Miss Aurora's dish next. \nAhh, it looks like an expensive dish.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_035@Hmm~ delicious! \nBut... it tastes like a dish out of a high-end restaurant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_036@It is tasty, retaining both the tenderness and the elasticity of the beef. \nBut just like Yui said, this seems like a high-end dish from a high-end restaurant.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_037@Wh- What do you mean?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_038@Since everyone has tasted the dishes, we shall proceed with the judging!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_039@I vote for Kana~ \nA familiar taste, heartwarming dish is my favorite!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_040@Hmm, I vote for Kana too. \nThe new dish is delicious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_041@Today's topic was a homecooked meal. \nBased on that, I vote for Kana too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_042@Huh—? \nHold on, that isn't fair!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_043@Hey now, you asked for this match, and you agreed to the terms. \nOr are all professional chefs just full of it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_044@Ugh— Damn it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_2_045@Hehe, then according to the agreement before, \nthe loser owes the winner a wish!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_001@As per my request, Aurora has agreed to be the chef at the form for a month. \nShe has been here a week now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_002@Aurora~ We'll leave dinner in your hands then~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_003@Huh— Why must I cook for free here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_004@Miss Aurora, I can help you~ \nThere are more people eating at the dorm today, so there's more work to be done~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_005@Hmm, cough, I'm not forcing you to help though.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_006@Hmm~ I just thought I could steal a thing or two from Miss Aurora's exceptional cooking skills~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_007@Hmph... you are the one who won. \nWhat would you have to learn from a... loser?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_008@But I know that Miss Aurora is much more capable than me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_009@What about it? I still lost, which means I'm not good enough. \nAnd this world is only interested in results.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_010@Leave, I'll do it myself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_011@Then... if you need help, you must ask me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_012@Clank—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_013@Didn't I say I'll do it alone— \nArghhhh ahhh— There's a gh- ghost—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_015@Eh eh? Mr player— someone's fainted!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_016@After listening to Berry, \nI didn't know if Aurora was overworked, or really scared unconscious by Berry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_017@But since we're here, I thought if we ought to put an end to the charade. \nWe'll see when she comes to.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_018@Aurora, are you alright? \nYou can chop off a chicken's head, but you faint at the sight of a ghost?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_019@What just... Eh? Was there a...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_020@Y- You! \nWhy didn't you tell me that the dorm was haunted?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_021@Who knew you were afraid of them? \nHold on, this place is not haunted, alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_022@Then the pot lid I just saw floating mid-air...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_023@...Okay, since you found out, \nthat was Berry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_024@You... You've named the ghost?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_025@That was her name all along. \nDue to certain reasons, Berry stayed on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_026@I'll be honest. If you're scared, we can end the agreement right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_027@I—! I'm not scared, I can stay!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_028@Your pale face isn't helping your case. \nForget it, you better leave.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_029@I don't want to see bloodshed in the dorm. \nIt'll be troublesome if you die from shock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_030@Hold on! I'm okay, I can do it!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_031@You didn't come here of your own free will. \nIf you're here to save face, you can let go and give yourself a break.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_032@I can't limit Berry's movements just because you're afraid.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_033@I... I can try to overcome this. Please, let me stay!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_034@Surprisingly, Aurora softened from her usual arrogance and begged in earnest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_035@...Why are you so persistent when you're obviously scared?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_036@At least tell me something. \nSo I can consider whether or not I wanna let you stay.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_3_037@Well... That takes us back to a long time ago...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_001@My mom... she's a chef. \nShe always bustled in the kitchen while she brought me up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_002@Whenever I saw her focused expression... \nI thought that was the most beautiful thing in the world.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_003@So I decided to become a chef as well, and I vowed that I would be the best chef in the world.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_004@As for ghosts... There was one time when I saw my mom watching a horror movie. \nI went over because I was curious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_005@Perhaps because I was too young, I got a trauma that I never quite recovered from.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_006@But this shall not be my obstacle!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_007@Even though I am scared of ghosts, I wish to stay... \nso I can learn from Kana about the things I lack...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_008@Even if I lost, I wish to learn from the one who beat me...! \nThat is my resolve!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_009@Up to this point, Aurora started becoming embarrassed. \nIt's probably because she seldom shows her weakness before others?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_010@Her wanting to perservere even though she was scared to death \nwas enough to move me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_011@Aurora, wait here. \nI'm gonna get something for you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_012@I walked swiftly to the kitchen, got out some utensils, knives and food materials.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_013@With my beginner's technique, I made a plate of unidentifiable, simple dish.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_014@Eh? Wh- What is this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_015@Come on, give it a try?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_016@...Hmm, it tastes... quite special.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_017@You can say bad... \nSee, I know nothing about cooking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_018@Sorry, we seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_019@Honestly, I planned the match just a good laugh and to get a free professional chef.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_020@So... It wasn't really a free match.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_021@I hope you can accept my apology. \nI shouldn't have faced your dreams and fears with that attitude.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_022@Aurora remained silent the whole time she listened to me. \nHer eyes moved towards my hands...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_023@player is a beginner after all.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_024@You held the knife wrong, so you hurt yourself, didn't you?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_025@Actually... I think I should apologize too. \nI was too rash, and that's why these things happened.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_026@I might have even caused trouble for Kana...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_027@As for that... I can only tell you that Kana loves cooking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_028@So if you get a chance to talk to her, and talk about cooking, \nI bet she'd be elated.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_029@Okay, I will! \nSo, cough... now you know why I want to stay...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_030@Of course, you should stay if you want to! \nBut are you sure you're gonna be fine?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_031@Berry is not scary, she's adorable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_032@Alsom having a free professional chef cooking us awesome food everyday — \nwho could say no to that...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_033@I shall try my best to overcome things... I will try to get used to it at least!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_034@If you say so, we'll give it a try then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_035@Yup! Oh right, player, your cooking... \nwas really bad...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_036@Ahh... \nWell, we''ve always had Kana around, so...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_037@Aurora and I finished the dish as we criticized it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_038@Practice and perserverence. \nEven the worst chef can make a tasty dish one day.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_4_039@I suppose Aurora thinks so too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_001@Aurora has been honing her cooking skills even more diligently, so as to prepare for the annual cooking competition.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_002@One day, she brought a dish into my office.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_003@Oh, what's the matter? Wow... That looks delicious!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_004@Hehe, don't tell me you made it especially for me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_005@Cough, of course not. \nI just need a guinea pig for my new dish.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_006@I'll take it as a yes anyway... \nNom...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_007@How is it? Don't just eat, talk!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_008@My God... Aurora... \nThis... is simply amazing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_009@I don't know much about cooking, but I have tasted rather exquisite cuisines.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_010@With such potential, you're bound to be crowned champion in the competition!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_011@...Thank you, player.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_012@I gave the highest remark to Aurora's cuisine, hoping to instill her with confidence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_013@Looking at Aurora, I couldn't help but have other thoughts...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_014@I happened to know of a dish that is premium in taste, smell, and visuals... \nWanna give it a try?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_015@What is it...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_016@I walked behind Aurora, hugged her slender waist. \nMy hands roamed around her body freely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_017@Aurora's girly scent overwhelmed my senses. \nHer tender body was trembling slightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_018@Relax, let me take you through this special recipe, alright?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_019@I reached Aurora's buttons, and slowly undid them. \nHer two proud breasts exposed before me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_020@Her pink, soft nipples that resembled cherry blossom petals stood erect out of anticipation. \nI massaged her breasts and nipples, enjoying their tenderness in my hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_021@Hah— I'm feeling... ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_022@This is just a simple appetiser.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_023@Aurora leaned on my chest, panting softly, not resisting any of my moves.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_024@I caressed her gradually wetting pussy. \nMy juice-stained fingers massaged her clitoris with varying strength.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_025@Her pussy emitted a heat, as if it was longing to be filled by a meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_026@Looks like Aurora's pussy can't wait to taste a meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_027@My excited meat rod stood erect, \nmassaging between Aurora's fair thighs and pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_028@Aurora seemed to have sensed the toughness of the meat rod, and gave out a cry of shock. \nShe began moaning impatiently.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_029@player's meat rod... \nis so hard... ahh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_030@You'll know later, my meat rod can do more than just get hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_031@The meat rod was drenched in Aurora's juices. \nThey acted as the perfect lubricant, easing the rod's movements.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_032@Such stimulation drove me crazy. \nI aimed my meat rod right at the wet pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_033@Eh, hold on— ahh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_034@I had inserted the tip my meat rod into her pussy before she could even finish her sentence.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_035@Her elastic pussy swallowed up my meat rod inch by inch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_036@So, so big... ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_037@The tight and wet pussy has never been entered. \nBut the vaginal walls adapted perfectly to the size and shape of the meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_038@I held back the urge to plunge my meat rod into the depths of her pussy, and inched forward slowly, enjoying the warm sensation of being engulfed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_039@But Aurora hungrily moved her hips. \nHer pussy swallowed the meat rod again and again, giving rise to bouts of ecstasy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_040@Hmm... Someone's impatient... You won't get to savor it slowly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_041@I plunged my meat rod to the deepest part of her pussy, hearing Aurora moan out of shock. \nThere was hardly any gap between the meat rod and the pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_042@Mmm... It's too deep... ahhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_043@And for the main course now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_044@My meat rod stirred within the depths of Aurora's pussy. \nAs though stir-frying in the heat of the pan, we were creating the best of tastes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_045@Ahh... no... no...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_046@Aurora couldn't help herself being stimulated by the meat rod. \nShe mumbled to herself, and moved her hips to seek more excitement.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_047@Aurora's body... is amazing... mmm.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_048@The thrusting from the meat rod had no doubt added to the eroticism of it all. \nI held Aurora's body, and reclaimed the power to move.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_049@I thrusted my meat rod repeatedly into Aurora's pussy. \nThe loud pats against her butt had made my meat rod even harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_050@The usually arrogant Aurora succumbed to her desire to be plowed by the meat rod, moaning endlessly, \nher body matching the movement and speed of the meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_051@Such difference in her character made me want to plunge myself deeper into her, so that she had only my meat rod on her mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_052@Hehe... Looks like Aurora is very satisfied with my meat rod?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_053@I enjoyed the leisure of mumbling dirty words next to Aurora. \nShe looked ashamed but unable to resist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_054@Her tender pussy had turned red from my attack, but never ceased to secrete juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_055@Hah— hah— More ahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_056@The thrusting of the meat rod was melody to the ears. \nAurora's pussy contracted tightly, sucking onto the meat rod, causing me to almost cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_057@I can't let you off so easily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_058@I quickened up my pace. \nMy meat rod moved smoothly in her pussy, the walls getting wetter and tighter by the minute.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_059@Aurora had lost the ability to talk, fully immersed in the ecstasy of being filled.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_060@Mmm... Hah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_061@I hugged Aurora, stopping her from moving her hips. \nI penetrated her little pussy ruthlessly again and again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_062@Get ready for the main show!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_063@Give it... all to me... ahhhhhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_064@Her pussy contracted to the maximum, wrapping tightly around the meat rod. \nI could bear no longer, and shot my cum right into her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_065@Aurora also climaxed in a loud moan while being filled with my steamy white cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_066@After climax, Aurora laid on my chest, panting slightly. \nThe thick white cum flowed slowly out of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h1_067@player's meat rod... is indeed the most premium cuisine...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_001@I finished the squad's report, and felt hungry. \nSo I went to the kitchen in search for food.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_002@Unsurprisingly, Aurora was there, seemingly pondering about something.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_003@Aurora, what's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_004@Ahh, it's player. I was thinking what kind of dessert Kana would like.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_005@Kana... she isn't picky with dessert.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_006@But why are you making dessert for Kana all of a sudden?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_007@Mmm, cough, it's nothing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_008@... Ahh I know, it's because her birthday is coming up. \nHow thoughtful of you, Kana will be over the moon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_009@Seeing Aurora's embarrassed expression from getting her plan busted, \nI couldn't help but smile, thinking how cute she looks when she gets shy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_010@Oh right, I don't know what Kana likes... \nBut I do have a favorite dessert.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_011@I just don't know if you can make it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_012@I walked up to Aurora, hugging her waist.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_013@Aurora was shy but unwilling to back down, looking at me in protest.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_014@Wh- Why don't you try me... ahh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_015@I pushed Aurora down on the kitchen counter before she could finish.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_016@I held her extended leg in one hand, \nunbuttoning her shirt in the other, removing both of our clothes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_017@Aurora's plump breasts and graceful figure exposed themselves to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_018@A beautiful body is the best dessert.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_019@What kind of logic is that... ahh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_020@I massaged Aurora's thighs. \nShe gave off soft moans of shock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_021@Aurora's body is surprisingly pliable.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_022@Wh- What do you mean... ahh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_023@I held my bulging meat rod, and massaged between her stocking-laced legs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_024@I thought Aurora wasn't the athletic type, \nso you might be stiff.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_025@I didn't expect you'd be able to put up with this position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_026@This is not a particularly difficult position. \nBut Aurora's legs are bent in the way that eases the movement of my meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_027@You're getting wet soon. Your stockings and panties are getting wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_028@It's all... your fault... hnh ahh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_029@Aurora's body was sensitive. \nI merely massaged a few times, when her pussy secreted juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_030@A translucent pink glistened underneath the stockings where her pussy was, as if a soft bud waiting to blossom. \nHer pussy trembled slightly from desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_031@Hmm... your pussy is getting hot and wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_032@My meat rod felt the heat emitting from her pussy. \nThe wet juices also found their way onto the meat rod through my movements.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_033@I removed her stockings. \nUnwilling to hold back any longer, I thrusted my meat rod into her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_034@Ahh— it's too big... hold on...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_035@The meat rod entered her pussy, as her pussy wrapped around it. \nI controlled my speed, savoring the heat of her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_036@From my relentless thrusting, the sticky juices flowed out of the pussy and spread to the corners of the pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_037@Aurora's pussy seems hungry. \nYou're eating up a big meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_038@Aurora was about to retort when I thrusted a few times. \nShe moaned reluctantly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_039@My meat rod stirred in her pussy, while her juices flowed nonstop.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_040@You should be able to see it, right? \nSee your pussy gobble up my meat rod deliciously.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_041@I- I can't... ahh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_042@I said dirty words to spur her on. \nEvery time Aurora tried to reply, I thrusted deep and hard, so all she could make was seductive moans.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_043@A few rounds later, the tight pussy seemed to have relaxed a little.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_044@I moved my hips, speeding up my thrusts. \nThe meat rod stirred in the wet pussy, causing lewd juices to flow down Aurora's thighs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_045@Hah— relax, and enjoy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_046@I comforted Aurora who could hardly speak from the movements. \nI held her thighs to secure the position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_047@Her beautiful breasts were swinging from the thrusting, forming a graceful arc.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_048@The sounds of our copulation was mixed with the wet sounds of the juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_049@Can you hear that? That is your pussy enjoying my meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_050@Aurora could only immerse herself in the ecstasy of being filled by the meat rod. \nHer tender flesh exposed at the opening of the pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_051@The tight pussy sucked onto the meat rod, as it contracted further. \nHer juices flowed even more while I mumbled more dirty words.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_052@Hah— hah— I want more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_053@As you wish then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_054@I held Aurora's hips and thighs tightly, speeding up my movements. \nHer breasts swung in larger motion.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_055@Aurora's body twisted subconsciously, seeking more impact from the meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_056@I stood my meat rod up, and pounded it into the deepest part of the pussy. \nThe meat rod was fully swallowed by the pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_057@The excitement that built up from the thrusting and the pussy sucking so hard on the meat rod, \nhad made me want to abandon all reason and just fill her pussy with my cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_058@I'm cumming— take it all!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_059@Hnh ahh— ahhhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_060@My cum and meat rod filled Aurora's pussy fully. Aurora climaxed in a loud and high-pitched moan. \nShe panted weakly in the aftermath.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_061@The white cum mixed with her love juices was pushed out of her pussy by the bulging meat rod.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_h2_062@Hah, hah— Thanks for the treat...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_001@On an afternoon, Aurora was pondering alone in the kitchen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_002@Hah— How can I lessen the impact of butter on the soup...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_003@If the butter is too overpowering, people might not be able to enjoy it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_004@Afternoon, Miss Aurora~ Are you thinking up new ideas for dinner?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_005@Cough, I was just thinking up new combinations for the food materials we have on hand.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_006@Relax~ If you frown too often, you're gonna get wrinkles~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_007@I tweaked the way to make dessert last week. \nI was wondering if I could get Miss Aurora's opinion on it~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_008@Hmph, I have some time now, so let's give it a go.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_009@Kana's petite silhouette bustled around next to the kitchen counter.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_010@Aurora couldn't help getting close to see how Kana made her dessert.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_011@Does Miss Aurora prefer a sweeter taste?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_012@I'm fine with anything. I rarely eat dessert anyway.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_013@Eggs, milk, and sugar... \nYou're making... pudding?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_014@Yes~ It's an ordinary dessert. \nBut I adjusted the ratio of the spices, and switched the brand for the ingredients.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_015@I wonder if that will make better pudding?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_016@Hmm, technically yes. \nI'm not familiar with desserts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_017@But ingredients and spices greatly impact the taste and texture of the food — \nthat goes without saying.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_018@Oh right, it matters also how long we put it to rest. \nI take note of that too.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_019@Err, I mean... That's about it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_020@Hehe, Miss Aurora really loves cooking.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_021@Whenever you talk about food, Miss Aurora's eyes just sparkle~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_022@Th- That's not strange! \nAnyway this shouldn't be resting this long, should it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_023@Ehh~~ Oh dear, I almost forgot~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_024@I'm making this specially for Miss Aurora... \nIt won't taste good if it's rested too long...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_025@Hmph... it's no big deal. \nI've tasted player's horrendous stir-fried green peppers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_026@No matter what, your dessert won't taste worse than those green peppers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_027@Huhu~ alright. \nI shall ask Miss Aurora to wait just a little bit more then~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_1_028@That afternoon, the two girls ate dessert, and enjoyed a casual tea time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_001@I felt great after tasting Kana's dessert that day...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_002@Maybe I ought to try making dessert.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_003@We made dessert for tea today, but I don't know what the others like.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_004@Hmm~ I like anything sweet~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_005@What a careless answer — \nHold on... aren't I the only one here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_006@It's a ghost, ghost —
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_007@Hold on~ I have a name~ \nBesides... I don't look scary~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_008@Ahh — Gh- Ghosts are just ghosts ahh —
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_009@My name is Berry!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_010@B- Berry...? Come to think of it, player seems to have mentioned this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_011@player thinks of you as a part of the dorm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_012@Yup! And I like everyone at the dorm~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_013@I think I need some mental preparation...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_014@Talking to someone invisible, just makes me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_015@You're making dessert~ \nWow~ This looks amazing!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_016@Cough, this is pretty basic. \nY- You can have a taste though.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_017@But... ghosts should be unable to eat, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_018@Hmm~ I don't really have a need to eat~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_019@Oh right! I heard from Mr player that you are really good at cooking!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_020@Can you teach me~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_021@It- It's not like I can't. \nBut you don't get hungry at all, why do you wanna learn to cook...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_022@I... I also wish to make a good dish for Mr player, and the others at the dorm!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_023@Because everyone takes really good care of me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_024@If... if only I could do something for them, that will be best!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_026@Okay, I shall teach you the meaning of premium cuisine!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_027@Listen, the first step to cooking, is to show respect for the ingredients...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_028@The warm sun shone into the kitchen, giving glow to everything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P042_N_2_029@A girl held a knife and taught seriously at the air...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_1@Okay, let’s end today’s training here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_10@Rrng~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_11@Tomoka falls onto the ground again and again. I bet she must be sore all over by now if she didn’t have such a plump ass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_12@I told you to use the power of the whole body... You’re too relaxed!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_13@Hmph~!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_14@Tomoka makes a face at me and props herself up to roll around on the ball again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_15@I look carefully at Tomoka’s breasts that wobble around softly as she moves. I must admit that this is scene can catch the eyes of any man.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_16@I swallow hard as naughty thoughts fill my head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_17@Ahem, I’m going to help you so that you can focus on finding your balance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_18@Since Tomoka can't do anything to resist me, I lift her shirt and start kneading her breasts with my hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_19@Eh...? Wait, what...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_2@Thank you—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_20@I place my hand against one of her breasts and find myself unable to reach around it with one hand. My fingers sink into her breast.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_21@I can get addicted to this feeling if I’m not careful. I fondle Tomoka’s breast and rub her nipple with my index finger.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_23@Tomoka starts moaning as her nipples become hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_24@Mmmm.... Aahhh... Coach... I can’t use any power if you do this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_25@That’s just an excuse. You already knew this would happen right? You must have been waiting expectantly for this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_26@Why else would you become like this just from having your breasts touched? Even your pants are wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_27@I can see very clearly from this angle that the space between Tomoka’s legs has become a wet patch that is obvious even on bloomers.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_28@Tomoka can’t hide it from me anymore so she looks at me with round puppy eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_3@Phew~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_30@There’s no helping it... I’ll teach you how to use your power.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_31@I pull down Tomoka’s pants along with her panties.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_32@The sticky fluid that connects Tomoka’s pussy with her panties shows me that she is already soaking wet. I bet I can stick it in directly if she’s already liken this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_33@Hehe. Without saying anything, I stick my cock directly in Tomoka’s pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_34@Aaaahhh... What...? Is this...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_35@This is the cock method of generating force. You should do your best to remember the feeling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_36@I start swaying my hips back and forth rhythmically.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_37@It truly does require technique to use force like this, but I don’t think Tomoka is interested in learning that right now since my hot and hard cock is entering her again and again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_38@It feels so good... But... Aahhh... It feels a little strange...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_39@Tomoka’s face is filled with confusion, but the pleasure makes her forget to struggle.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_4@Tomoka...hold on.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_40@Unlike her confused personality, Tomoka’s sexy and sensitive body has already given in to the pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_41@Her wet and hot pussy is penetrated by my cock repeatedly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_43@I don’t really know what’s going to happen but I’m going to enjoy this ride while it goes on... Since Tomoka is enjoying herself so much right now, I don’t need to hold back either.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_44@I raise Tomoka’s leg high and push onto it so that it fully exposes her plump ass and pussy to me, so I have a clear view of where we are connected.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_45@My thick cock enters and leaves her tight, pink pussy, making all sorts of squishy noises.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_46@Because her back is against an unstable ball, her giant breasts jiggle about intensely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_47@This is just too stimulating.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_48@My blood races, making me thrust even faster to make Tomoka moan louder and louder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_5@Eh...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_50@Tomoka, you're just amazing. You can still sense that. This is your favorite cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_51@The sounds of our intercourse fill the room. The position we’re in makes it possible for me to reach very deep inside her every time I thrust... The feeling of having my entire cock massaged by her pussy is simply amazing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_52@After being fucked for a while, Tomoka loses the ability to think and just moans loudly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_54@Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_55@Tomoka’s entire body spasms as she climaxes, and even her toes curl up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_56@Her pussy walls suck lasciviously onto my cock to extract every single drop of cum inside her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_57@Aaaaaaaah...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_58@Tomoka trembles slightly as she feels my burning hot cum pouring inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_59@Ah... I... I like this a lot...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_6@You keep running away from training! You stay back for extra training!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_60@Tomoka lies weakly on the ground with an expression of happiness.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_7@What!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P05_h3_9@Tomoka lies with her bag against the swiss ball according to my instructions and uses her core to roll the ball around.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_1@Late at night, I creep out of the dormitory with Rina and arrive at a nearby park.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_10@Rina clenches her fists like she wants to punch me, but I can tell that she is wavering.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_11@You’re looking forward to it too, right? Or else you wouldn’t have listened to me and worn that thing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_12@Hm... You...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_13@So... Shall we?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_15@I knew it! This really looks good on you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_16@Rina is crawling on all fours, completely naked other than a hoop that is fastened around her neck and connected to a leather rope that is in my hands.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_17@Hmph... I’ll kill you if anyone takes a photo of this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_18@Although you say that, you're completely wet down there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_2@It’s already after 12 midnight and the park is pitch black, so it’s a matter of fact that there’s no one here.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_20@I reach out and touch Rina’s pussy. Her hot and well-lubricated pussy sucks my finger in.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_21@Her love juices keep overflowing out of her pussy and my fingers are covered in a sticky fluid after a few touches.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_22@Look at yourself. You're obviously enjoying this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_23@I intentionally tease Rina’s clit, making her tremble all over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_24@Aaaahhhh—! Mmmmm... Aahhhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_25@Rina does her best to resist, but alluring moans keep escaping from her tightly closed lips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_26@Although Rina turns her head to glare at me, her vicious expression has faded from the pleasure that course through her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_27@Stop playing around... Quickly... Put it in me...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_28@I know, I know. You want it badly, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_29@I maliciously twist the meaning of Rina’s words and suddenly plunge my cock all the way into her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_3@Why did we come here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_30@Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh—Don’t stick it in so suddenly...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_31@The sudden burst of stimulation makes Rina scream out loud. She looks around anxiously then scolds me quietly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_32@But I ignore her and start moving my hips so that my cock keeps rubbing the sensitive spots inside her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_34@As I expected, Rina’s moaning soon becomes tender and wistful, and her fierce expression softens as she relaxes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_35@Mmm... Mmm... This feels so good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_36@Rina is so irresistible when she is honest about my cock. It makes me want to fuck her so badly!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_37@I clench my abs to thrust my cock hard and fast.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_38@Rina moans and tries to escape, but I pull onto the rope and keep her close to me so she can’t get away from the relentless assault of my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_39@Aaaahhh... Aaahhhhh... This is so intense... I’m going to cum... I'm going to... I’m cumming...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_4@Rina wraps her arms around herself defensively as she glares at me askance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_41@She came just like that? It seems like Rina enjoys having sex outdoors more than I expected.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_43@Rina pants and doesn’t even have the energy to say anything back to me. Weak from cumming so hard, Rina is so much cuter as she doesn't have her usual arrogance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_44@Her pussy hasn't stopped sucking on my cock though, and I don’t have the time to wait for her to recover.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_45@I thrust my hips again, sending my still erect cock deep inside Rina’s pussy again and making her scream out loud.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_46@Hey! Wait... I just came... Aaahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_47@You're welcome—I know you like it rough, right? Look, whenever my cock goes in like this, your pussy clenches it tightly...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_48@As I speak, I move my hips powerfully. I pull my cock out until my tip is at the very edge of her pussy and then plunge it back in all the way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_5@Why don’t we do something exciting?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_50@Exhausted from the being fucked, Rina wants to lie down on the floor but raises her ass subconsciously to make it easier for me to stir up her insides because she wants to feel good.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_52@Rina is a pervert who loves cocks right? I bet you can lust over a cock no matter how many people there are in front of you or whether you are outdoors.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_53@I keep saying things to humiliate Rina, but Rina can’t be bothered arguing with me anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_55@Rina’s face is filled with lust and both her body and mind have been enslaved by my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_56@I find it impossible to hold back my excitement when I see her like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_57@Cum for me, Rina! I’m giving you your favorite cock. Don’t hold back. Cum as hard as you can!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_59@Rina moans loudly as she cums and I also shoot my load inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_6@You...! Don’t tell me you want to do it in a place like this...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_60@Maybe we’ve already attracted the attention of the neighbors since we were so loud. But Rina and I don’t care about that right now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_61@Rina turns her head to look at me. Her pussy is filled up with my cock and cum, but her eyes are full of desire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_62@Haaa... I want more...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_7@Rina bursts into rage. I pull onto her arm and whisper close to her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P06_h3_8@Don’t get angry. Think about it. Having sex in a park completely naked late at night... Exposing all of our hidden pervertedness...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_1@I sit in the restaurant and wait happily for the chef to serve me my food.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_10@Kana’s shy expression is the best part about this meal. I can't resist reaching out to touch Kana, which makes her shriek in panic.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_12@What is it?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_13@I’m still... A little embarrassed...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_14@There’s no need to be shy. All you need to do is relax, Kana. Compared to this, weren’t you very concerned about the taste of the cream?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_15@Oh yes... Coach, please give it a try...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_16@Then I’ll start now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_17@I help myself to the cream on Kana’s breast along with her breast.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_19@This rough method of eating the cream smears the cream all over her breast.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_2@This is a feast that Kana has prepared just for me. Just the thought of that fills my heart with expectation.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_20@The sweetness of this cream is heightened by the soft and elastic feeling of this breast. I find myself licking her breast like I can't get enough of it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_21@Aaahhhh... If you do that... Aaahhhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_22@This is the last strawberry. I bit down on the strawberry along with her nipple, which makes Kana tremble all over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_23@No, you can’t do that...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_24@The strawberry is soft and juicy. I suck on its sweet juices while I chew.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_25@Aaahh... Don’t suck so hard...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_26@Probably because I was sucking too hard, Kana starts struggling. But I must finish all the food Kana prepared no matter what.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_27@I suck so hard that her breast changes shape temporarily. Kana trembles and moans like I’ve sucked out some breast milk.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_28@Ahaaaaaa!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_29@I loosen my lips and see her breast wet all over.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_3@Coach... It is ready now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_30@Kana lies weekly on the table, her face as red as a strawberry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_32@That was delicious, Kana. So it’s true that good presentation makes food even more delicious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_33@Oh, that's great...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_34@That's right, I should do some exercise after eating dessert. Will you accompany me, Kana?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_36@Before Kana realizes what's happening, I’ve taken off her panties and thrown them to the side.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_37@Look, your panties are already drenched. If they’re this wet, then your pussy must be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_38@I thrust my hips forward to push my cock inside her pussy all the way down to the base.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_39@Aaahhhh—!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_4@Kana’s shy voice travels over from the kitchen. I walk into the kitchen to see the meal Kana prepared waiting for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_40@... I reached the deepest part immediately.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_41@Aaahhh... Aahhhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_42@Kana trembles as her body spasms and her pussy clenches tight. Kana is especially sensitive and cute today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_43@Since you put so much effort into preparing this meal for me, I need to do my best to make you feel good too. I’ll be doing my best!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_44@Coach, wait...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_45@Kana looks at my cock leaving her pussy and wants to stop me, but she just watches as my cock enters her again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_46@Aaahhh—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_47@What is it, Kana?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_48@I ask her seriously as I thrust my hips. I watch Kana try to resist moaning so that she can answer me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_49@Aaahhh... Just... Ahhh... This is too sudden... Aahhh...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_5@This is K...Kana’s special dessert... I hope you enjoy it, coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_50@I’m sorry, you're just too cute, Kana. I can't wait any longer... Aaahh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_51@I thrust hard into her and then launch a barrage of thrusts. As a result, all Kana can do is moan.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_53@That’s because your pussy is so sticky right now. Do you feel good, Kana?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_54@I feel good... I feel really good... Mmmmmmmmmh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_55@Kana’s pussy also feels super good...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_56@*Slap* *Slap* *Slap* I keep thrusting as we speak. Her pussy feels so good that the only thing I want to do right now is keep thrusting my hips.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_57@My cock repeats a cycle of pushing open her pussy, stirring up her insides, and reaching all the way in. For a while, the only sounds that can be heard are the sounds of our bodies and moaning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_58@Aaahhhh... If you do that... I’m going to... Aaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_59@Her relentless, powerful orgasm brings Kana to the brink of cumming. As her pussy clenches me tightly, I can also feel myself getting close to cumming.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_6@Today’s dessert is strawberry cream. Round blobs of cream are highlighted with bright red strawberries that look absolutely delicious.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_60@Aaaaahhhh... I’m cumming! Aaaaahhhh!!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_61@I cum deep inside her pussy. As wave after wave of cum pours into her, Kana trembles as she climaxes again.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_62@Haaaa... Haaaa... Haaaaa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_63@I pull out my cock and watch my semen drip out of her pussy like fresh cream.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_64@It looks great! Kana, why don’t you try this dessert next time?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_65@Yes...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_7@Not to mention, this meal is served on Kana's flawless body. The cream flowers look like blooming flowers that decorate Kana’s body, making this meal a magnificent work of art.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_8@It looks really good.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P07_h3_9@Really? That’s great...! If coach likes it...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_1@Okay, we’re going to explain new tactics and strategies to you next so you better listen up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_10@An accident led to this but I think it's quite interesting now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_11@Kagano’s pussy clenches tight. I bet Kagano is feeling embarrassed and excited to be in such a shameful situation in the same room as the other girls.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_12@Ouch...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_13@What’s wrong, coach?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_14@Nothing, I squashed my foot with the chair...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_15@How dare Kagano squeeze my leg... But her resistance is futile!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_16@While the girls are focused on writing notes, I rock my hips vigorously a few times to get revenge.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_18@We might get found out if you make such loud noises.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_19@I don’t mind if we get caught, but it won’t be fun if we can't carry on like this.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_2@Coach, Kagano isn’t here yet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_20@I pull over a chair and sit down, then I start to read out the content of the textbook. Kagano starts getting impatient after she realizes that I’ve stopped moving.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_21@(How dare this guy ignore me....! Come on... Start moving!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_22@Kagano squeezes my leg again, but I ignore her. She is soon driven crazy by her body that has been teased to the extreme.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_23@(I can't take it any more... This thick and hot cock is inside me... I want it to start moving...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_24@Kagano glares grudgingly at the unmoving body of the man. Probably due to the influence of her lust, she remembers a dildo that she saw once in a video.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_25@To use that dildo, a woman had to slide herself up and down it like riding a horse. She was quite against it at that time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_26@But now, if only she has something like that, then she could...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_27@In a trance, Kagano starts moving her hips slowly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_29@(This feels so good. I can't stop anymore...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_3@Huh? Maybe she’s busy with something. It's all right since she sorted the contents of this class.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_30@As the cock rubs against her pussy, Kagano loses the ability to think and starts rubbing her breasts in a daze.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_31@This steamy scene happening right next to my feet makes it impossible for me to carry on with this class.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_32@Okay, that’s all for the theory today. You can practice the rest in the practice grounds. You can go there first. I’ll prepare something and then join you there.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_33@I find a random excuse to get the girls to leave. Kagano tries to get up after she hears that everyone else is gone, but I push her down and stick my cock in her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_34@Aaahhh... Aahhh... Don’t be like that... Aahahhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_35@I ravish Kagano’s pussy with my cock, making loud noises that remind me of when I spanked her bottom when she was little.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_36@This proud lady really does need to be punished!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_37@*Creak* As things heat up, the door opens suddenly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_39@What is it, Saki?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_40@Um... I think I hear some strange noises...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_41@That can't be. Maybe it was the sound of me talking to myself just then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_42@That’s right. Saki, can you wait for me in the corridor? You don’t need to close the door either. I’ll be out in a moment.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_43@Okay!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_44@Saki nods in agreement without suspecting anything and I can see the faint shadow of Saki waiting in the corridor from the open door.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_45@You! What are you thinking of doing?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_46@I hear Kagano scold me silently, but I respond with some powerful thrusts into her pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_48@The sudden and intense pleasure makes Kagano lose her mind for a moment, but when she recovers, she remembers that Saki is waiting nearby.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_49@Wait! Stop or else we’ll be found out...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_5@I look around the room from the podium and make sure that no one notices anything strange before I make the announcement .
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_50@Kagano hammers her fists against me but I ignore her protests. In fact, it makes me thrust even harder.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_51@Under the repeated assault of my cock, Kagano quietens down soon.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_53@The large movements of my cock causes her love juices to fly out of her pussy and all over her breasts and face.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_54@You like this right, Kagano? You feel even more excited when someone is outside, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_55@Aaaahhhhh I can’t hold it in any longer! My pussy is about to cum!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_56@The pace of my thrusting increases, making Kagano moan loudly and pushing her to the brink.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_58@I cum deep inside her pussy. In this position, it feels like my cum gushes into her womb directly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_59@After unloading every single drop of my semen inside Kagano, I pull out my clean cock and dress myself hastily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_6@Then let's start—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_60@Okay, it’s time to go to the practice grounds now. I don’t have time to let you prepare. You should hurry over after you get dressed.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_61@In the empty classroom, Kagano pants in a daze in a lewd position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_62@Haa... Haa... Haa...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_8@An almost inaudible moan travels from a corner of the room.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P08_h3_9@That’s because Kagano, who everyone else thinks is absent from this class, is actually under the podium next to me. She maintains a strange upside down posture with my cock between her legs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_1@As the coach of a team, I do things by the book but still receive strange gifts every now and then.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_10@This won’t do. Young master... What should I do...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_11@Itsuki is in a panic, but for some reason, her face is also a little red. At this moment, she hears the sound of footsteps approaching.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_12@!!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_13@Itsuki has nowhere to hide and doesn’t have enough time to return the bottle to its place, so she drinks it in a hurry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_14@Hmm? Itsuki, what are you doing here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_15@N-Nothing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_16@Itsuki is standing next to the desk that the stimulant was in and her face becomes redder and redder under my gaze. It isn't hard to understand what happened.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_17@Well... Itsuki, how about we make a bet? I won’t make a fuss about this if you win the bet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_18@What... Ah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_19@I grab Itsuki’s hand. She tries to pull her hand away but it’s too late.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_2@What type of stimulant is this? I don’t think it’ll work...? I wonder what the person who gave me this was thinking...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_20@I hang her up with her arms tied behind her back. Although I used basic knots that won’t hurt her, they’re still capable of incapacitating her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_21@(I was actually subdued so easily... My body has become numb...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_22@Do you know why your body has become numb even though it was clearly a stimulant?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_23@Because... Your body is already so sensitive that simply rubbing your skin will make you climax so hard that you won’t be able to stand straight...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_24@W-What are you saying? I-I don’t understand at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_25@You don’t understand? Then I’ll have to ask your body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_26@I lift one of her legs and rub my cock against her bare pussy in this exposed position.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_28@Itsuki’s body trembles from the touch and her love juices start flowing like a fountain.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_29@Itsuki, why are you so aroused? Could you have taken some drug?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_3@Coach!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_30@Ah... No, I don’t know what you're talking about...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_31@What a tough ninja. In that case, you can continue to stay like that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_32@I rub my cock against her pussy relentlessly. Her body has started to heat up. It’s obvious that the drug is making her horny.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_33@Loud wet noises fill the room as my cock rubs against her pussy. The erotic sound tells us both clearly that Itsuki’s pussy is completely drenched in her love juices.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_35@Itsuki clenches her teeth together as she tries to resist the pleasure. Because she knows that she’ll start moaning if she doesn’t do that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_36@But even though she can keep her moans in, her body ignores her will and starts to enjoy the pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_37@(Oh no... I’m feeling this hot and numb just from being rubbed by him... If this goes on...!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_39@Itsuki’s body has never experienced such a powerful orgasm from being rubbed. She even feels like she is about to wet herself, but she does her best to resist it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_4@I’m coming.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_40@Huff... Ha... Ha... Ha...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_41@Although she is powerless, Itsuki does her best to stand straight and doesn’t beg for mercy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_42@So you still won’t admit it? Then let’s inspect inside your body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_43@After being lubricated by her love juices, my cock is ready to explore inside her. It is as hard and firm as a flagpole and it points at Itsuki’s pussy invasively.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_44@As she feels my cock press against her pussy lips, Itsuki seems a little agitated and nervous, but she has no way to stop my cock from invading her—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_45@Aaaaahhh—it’s inside me... Mmm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_46@As my cock enters her inch by inch, Itsuki’s body shakes with expectation. Her soft and moist pussy seems to thirst for my cock and some action.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_47@Seeing her like that, I choose to rub my cock around Itsuki’s pussy instead, which makes Itsuki sob.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_48@What about now, Itsuki? As long as you tell me the truth, I’ll let you cum as much as you like.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_49@I don’t know... I just know that... I want cock...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_5@I throw the drug into the drawer and leave, but little do I know that a shadow sneaks in from the window soon after I leave.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_50@There’s no helping it. Since you said that, I don’t think I have any other choice than giving it to you.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_51@*Whoosh* My cock starts to move inside her slowly after it is inside her completely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_53@Under the effect of the drug, Itsuki’s body is so sensitive that her pussy heats up like in a fire.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_54@Her pink pussy swallows my cock whole and then clenches it tight.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_55@This comfortable and erotic side of modern Itsuki arouses some most primal instincts of males. I press her thigh tightly and thrust even faster.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_57@The sounds of our lovemaking fill the air. As I savor her body, I feel so excited that I almost feel like I drank the stimulant myself.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_58@My erect cock stirs up the insides of Itsuki’s body as it moves in and out, causing love juices to fly everywhere.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_6@It’s been a long time since I infiltrated this place for an investigation... The young master was acting so suspiciously just then... How concerning...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_60@Sensing that Itsuki is about to cum, I speed up my thrusts further to push her to the top.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_62@Her pussy clenches tight as she spasms and my cock shoots semen inside her. A large amount of semen has filled her pussy up. Now it’s time to soothe her aroused body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_64@Itsuki’s eyes flicker with a wet glow, almost as if she is savoring the feeling of each drop of cum inside her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_65@Things are already like this, but Itsuki still refuses to say anything about the drug. But then again, that isn’t important anymore.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_66@I know this has nothing to do with the stimulant. The reason you're like this is because you craved my cock in the first place.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_7@Hmm? There seems to be something in the drawer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_8@Itsuki finds the stimulant in the unclosed drawer and is filled with shock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P09_h3_9@T-This is... Could the young master be involved in the trading of this item...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_1@─6:00 a.m.─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_11@Ah... H-Hello...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_12@Ahhh~ What a cute little girl~\nI've never seen you around before. Were you the one that cleaned the kitchen and Coach's room?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_13@Such a considerate and caring little girl!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_14@L-Little girl...?\nJ-Just... who are you calling a little girl?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_15@Uh... I mean...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_16@I'm 18 and already an adult!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_17@By the way, how come you can walk into stupid player's room like it's your own?!\nSuch a rude woman!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_18@You're calling me r-rude...?!\nT-This is our Squirt Gun team's dormitory and training facility...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_19@You're the one that's trespassing and calling Coach only by his name!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_2@……zzZZZZ……
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_20@What? You have a problem with that now?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_21@Yawnnn... What's going on?\nWhy are you guys fighting so early in the morning...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_22@Hmphh... Stupid player, you're finally awake!\Help explain who I am to this woman!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_23@Z-Zumi?! A-Aren't you studying abroad?\nWhat are you doing back?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_24@Huh? Did you not get my message?\nI can't believe it! Just how busy do you have to be to miss a message from your family?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_25@Let me see, let me see...\nOh man... Mom really sent me a message about you coming back...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_26@Hmphh... Stupid player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_27@So... Zumi really is intimate with Coach enough to be so rude to you...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_28@She and her sis were my childhood friends. We live next door and would have sleepovers when we were younger, so we're close like family.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_29@Her s-sister...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_3@Sigh... Some things never change, still asleep at this hour...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_30@Speaking of which, where's Yiliy?\nDid she come back too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_31@Hmphh! You sure care a lot about big sis!\nDon't worry, she should still be at a cafe reading. She didn't want to disturb you so early in the morning.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_32@Then how come you decided to come at the crack of dawn...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_33@T-That's not important! I just wanted to get a head start familiarizing myself with the environment...\nThat way I won't get lost... when I return with Yiliy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_34@But... haven't you been here before...?\nThe only one that might get lost should be Yiliy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_35@S-Stupid player! I'm going to be angry if you keep flapping your gums!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_4@What a pigsty... There are clothes all over the floor and sofa...\nIf mom was to see this, she would surely have an aneurysm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_5@Sigh... What am I to do with you? Stupid player... you better get down on your knees and thank me when you wake up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_6@─7:00 a.m.─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_7@Ahh~ I woke up a bit later than usual. I remember that Coach has an appointment at nine...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_8@Someone tidied up the kitchen already...?\nCould it be Kana?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_1_9@Eh...?! How come Coach's room is spotlessly clean too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_1@Stupid player, wake up already!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_10@Hey sis, I've made your eggs just how you like them. Eat up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_11@Alright... Thanks, Zumi.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_12@Here! These are yours.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_13@Wow! Pan seared fish and miso soup... It's been forever since I've had these...\nI usually just grab whatever, since I'm always in a hurry to leave...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_14@Hmphh! I knew that you would eat garbage food if I wasn't around to keep an eye on you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_15@W-What do you mean... Coach usually only eats garbage food...!\nAlthough... it's true that I've been slacking lately... I've only been baking cakes and bread for Coach...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_16@K-Kana... She doesn't mean it!\nHey! Zumi~ you better apologize to Kana right now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_17@I'm... s-sorry... I didn't know that you're the one who would usually make breakfast for stupid player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_18@I-I want to issue a challange to you!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_19@A c-challenge?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_2@Ahhh~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_20@You seem to be quite confident in your cooking skills.\nLet's put it to the test in a battle! This time I'll be taking things seriously!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_21@─Two hours later─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_22@Seeing how you both seem done with your dishes... I'll be the judge for this competition...\nFirst up is Kana...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_23@I made a Spanish seafood paella and ratatouille seasoned with sea salt!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_24@The low calorie and protein-rich seafood along with healthy vegetables can perfectly meet Coach's daily nutrient needs.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_25@Oh wow! This looks absolutely delicious!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_26@Mhmm! Both the presentation and taste is perfect!\nYou can really taste Kana's expert cooking skills.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_27@Hehe~ You flatter me, Coach~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_28@Now... next up is Zumi's dish...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_29@I made a beef rice bowl with pork miso soup... Have a taste...\nIt's not like I spent all morning making it... but I better not see any leftovers!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_3@Just look at the time! You're still sleeping?!\nHurry up and get ready for breakfast! You still have an appointment later, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_30@(Hehe~ She actually plans to compete with something so easy to make. It looks like victory is mine!)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_31@Isn't this an ordinary rice bowl...? What's so time consuming about this...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_32@Just shut up and take a bite! You can ask questions later.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_33@Alright... geez... Mhmm...\nThis... tastes just like your mom's special rice bowl... It's exactly the same...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_34@Coach suddenly started shoveling the rice bowl into his mouth...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_35@The rich fragrance of garlic and onions perfectly stimulates my palate.\nI just can't get enough of the rice drizzled in the sauce of the meat along with the runny yolk of a soft boiled egg!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_36@What's most prominent is the thick smoky flavor of the beef...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_37@I cooked it with white charcoal, so it took me a bit longer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_38@Yes! This is the familiar taste...\nI haven't had it ever since I left the neighborhood!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_39@My god... This is delicious...\nZ-Zumi... I'd like another bowl!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_4@I can't imagine the decadent lifestyle you usually live!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_40@There's no more! Who knew that you would be such a pig!\nNext time I'll prepare more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_41@Seeing how much Coach enjoyed Zumi's cooking... It seems that the outcome of this competition has already been decided... Kana has lost...\nKana thought that Coach would've been impressed with the presentation and taste of the dish...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_42@Kana has lived with Coach for so long, yet Kana has never known that Coach enjoys eating stuff like this...\nKana thought that she was the one that knew Coach the best... Sob~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_43@Kana... this isn't your fault. I've never had the chance to bring it up before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_44@But... Zumi... why do you know how to make your mom's special rice bowl...?\nYou didn't even know how to cook before...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_45@I... I...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_46@I-It's not important! I still have to feed myself now that I'm living alone outside, don't I?!\nNot everyone has people to look after them!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_47@Hmm... Why did she run off...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_48@Hehe~ Zumi is still so bashful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_49@Really? Are you sure she isn't mad...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_5@You're just like my mom... You both love to nag...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_50@After Zumi moved abroad, she would badger mother to teach her how to make your favorite dishes. She even took notes on the side.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_51@Her notebook is filled with stuff about you~\nSadly, she isn't the best at expressing her feelings...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_52@Zumi...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_6@Just get down for breakfast and make it snappy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_7@Ah~ player... good morning...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_8@Morning, Yiliy...\nAre you still getting used to things back here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_2_9@Hehe... Thanks for looking out for me. I'm used to being wherever you and Zumi are.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_1@Hey... stupid player!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_10@I know that stupid player easily gets full of himself the moment someone kisses his ass!\nLet's see how much of a laughing stock you'll make of yourself during the banquet!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_11@Who would make fun of me? You're such an uptight and troublesome little brat~\nYou worry too much. I'll bring back huge sponsorships. Just you wait and see!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_12@T-Troublesome?! Don't get me wrong, I'm not worrying about you! You dummy!\nHmphh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_13@─Three hours later─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_14@If I recall correctly... the venue for the banquet should be around here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_15@I-I'm... I'm not worrying about stupid player!\nI'm just here to see him make a fool of himself, and then laugh at him... 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_16@Bang...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_17@W-What's that?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_18@Ahhh! You dummy... That fall looks so painful...\nHe's completely buried in a pile of trash...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_19@Just how much did you drink... to be so wasted...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_2@Huh...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_20@ZZZzzzZZzz…
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_21@So disgusting... Oy! Dummy! Time to wake up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_22@Hey boss~ I... can still drink!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_23@You dummy! You don't even know that you're lying in a pile of trash, and you still want to keep drinking?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_24@Really now... How could you call me troublesome while being such a handful yourself!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_25@Hup! This dummy weighs a ton...\nAt least I've finally helped him change into a new set of clothes and dressed his wounds...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_27@It's really quite impressive how he can still be asleep after all this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_28@Just how much did he drink... He's covered in filth and scrapes...\nSigh... Having such a stupid childhood friend is really a handful...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_29@Z-Zumi...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_3@You have a... date later, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_30@...Eh...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_31@Zumi... I'm fine... ZZzzzzZZ… I'm not...\nSee... I... am I doing... OK?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_32@Dummy... You're still thinking of me in your dreams... What am I to do with you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_33@Life's hard... abroad... I'll... help you both live a better life...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_34@The one that is being taken care of is actually worrying about other people... Really now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_36@Hmm... But seeing how hard you're working... What do I do...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_37@I... I... really don't know what to do... It's not my fault that you're my stupid childhood friend...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_38@J-Just this once... Thank you for still keeping us in your heart...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_39@This... is my gift of gratitude... Don't wake up now.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_4@It's only a routine lunch gathering for leaders, what's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_40@Smooch...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_42@Next time... don't you dare complain about my age and inexperience...\nGot that...? You big dummy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_5@Leaders?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_6@The Squirt Gun Competition association invites the leaders and captains of Squirt Gun teams to have lunch together with sponsors. Everyone that is invited is either some bigwig or CEO of some company!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_7@Oh... it sounds like a boring adult meeting...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_8@This is the perfect opportunity to break into the upper echelons of society!\nYou don't have much social experience yet, so you don't understand the importance of these meetings!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_3_9@W-Who are you calling inexperienced?!\nYour smug and arrogant attitude is so revolting!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_1@First, seperate the yolk from the egg white, then properly mix the yolk...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_10@Hey... stupid childhood friend of mine!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_12@Um... maybe they didn't hear us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_13@I said... dummy! The noodles are ready! Do you hear me?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_15@H-How about I go call him over...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_16@What a dummy...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_19@Eh... Zumi? What's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_2@Got it... teacher!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_20@You... stupid dummy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_21@W-What's wrong? Why are you suddenly yelling at me...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_22@You said that you wanted to eat carbonara, so Kana and I made it for you...\nWho knew that you were so engrossed in chatting it up with these girls that you didn't even hear us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_23@I-I'm sorry... I really didn't hear you guys...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_24@Ever since you became coach of this Squirt Gun team... don't you think that there is constantly an entourage of girls trying to kiss your ass for a chance to compete in the games?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_25@You were never popular back then... Why else would a dummy like you be surrounded by a group of girls!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_26@Just look at you now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_27@Zumi! Don't you think that you're being too harsh?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_28@I'm just saying the truth! Have you forgotten who you are after all these girls and sponsorships cozied up to you?nYou are just someone who always need others to take care of the mess you leave behind!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_29@Who would want to be with a dummy like you if you weren't the coach of a Squirt Gun team?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_3@Next, prepare some cheese and add it to the yolk before it congeals in the pan... \nThat completes the hollandaise sauce...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_30@Enough! Zumi!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_32@We are all very close friends, and what's wrong with that!\nI don't care if you want to meddle in my business, but how dare you insult my friends. I want you to apologize to everyone right now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_33@... You... idiot...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_34@Don't just run off now! Zumi!\nApologize, now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_35@I think that this incident...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_36@Yiliy... you also think that Zumi is in the wrong here, right...?\nPlease, can you go talk some sense into her?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_37@I think that the person at fault here is... you, player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_38@W-What...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_39@Zumi and Kana cooked for you because you asked her to...\nBut you completely disregarded them, doing your own thing...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_4@Teacher, the noodles are ready!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_40@Zumi has helped you with many things without asking for anything in return, but you never noticed or ever gave thanks...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_41@She isn't the best at expressing herself, so she just holds it in, and in, and in...\nUntil she can't hold it in any longer... then she vents her anger...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_43@Go apologize to her... Seeing how... you are the person she likes the most...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_44@Dummy, dummy, dummy!\nStupid player will really be the death of me...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_46@Wahhh! Stupid player, what are you doing in my room without my permission?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_47@I'm sorry...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_48@Y-You're sorry?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_49@Yiliy told me everything. You've done so much for me...\nYet, I have taken everything for granted...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_5@Ok, I'll fry up another strip of bacon. In the meantime, can you drain the noodles and then return them to the pot...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_51@You dummy... You plan on being let off the hook with just a simple apology...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_52@What should I do to earn your forgiveness?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_53@H-Hug me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_54@Ok...W-Wait, come again?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_55@N-Nothing! Dummy! You didn't hear anything!\nDummy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_6@Ok! All done!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_7@The last step is to drizzle on the hollandaise sauce to complete stupid player's favorite carbonara. Do you remember all the steps? 
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_8@Yes! Kana has remembered everything!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_4_9@Alright, let's call stupid player in to eat!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_1@Even though sis, stupid player, and I are a family, there's still something that's only between Sis and I. It was something that happened when I was in junior high school...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_10@... Sis, am I... funny in this way?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_11@You're not. Because...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_12@I feel the same way as Zumi does.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_14@But if player knows about it, he must feel bashful, right? So...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_15@Sis reached out her right pinky and smiled at me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_16@I won't tell anyone. This is the tiny secret between Zumi and me.\nLet's protect player secretly together.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_17@... Sure. And since player is so stupid. He will never find it out if we don't say a thing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_19@Along with sis's laughter, our pinkies tied with each other, forming a warm vow.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_2@Weird. Where is it...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_3@Zumi, are you looking for this?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_4@Sis!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_5@You forgot it on the dining table. Here. Remember to put it away in a proper place~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_6@... Sis, did you read it? My diary...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_7@Well... I didn't mean to read it, but it was opened when Zumi left it on the table...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_8@Zumi cares about player a lot. I saw him almost occupied the whole page in your diary.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_1_9@Th-That's because stupid player is just so stupid that I have to worry about him a lot!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_1@Not after stupid player apologized for the Carbonara did I realize that sis had persuaded him to do so.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_11@... I've picked out my outfit and put on my makeup. It has only been ten minutes... I should go to sis's room first.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_12@Just when I arrive in her room, I hear her humming.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_13@Hehe~ Parasol, handkerchief... Zumi is pretty weak against hot weather, so I should also prepare tools to protect her from the sun and to wipe off her sweat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_14@Right, and water. I should add some juice she likes into it so that she feels cooler when drinking it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_15@Sis is still in a simple outfit, with her bag opened on the bed. It is filled with things she has prepared for me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_16@... Sis!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_17@Woah! Zumi? Why the sudden hug?... Are you still being affectionate to your sister at such an age?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_19@I nod and see sis get surprised with her eyes wide open. How shamful it is. So I bury my face back into sis's breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_2@Sis has been taking care of me secretly, yet I have focused my mind on stupid player, his dorm, and his team ever since we got back to the country.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_20@Sis... Sis is, and will always be my favorite person.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_3@... I feel like... I haven't been together with sis for a long time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_5@Sis... Are you free afterwards?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_6@Of course. I always have time for Zumi~ What's up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_7@It has been a long time since the last time we went shopping together. And Kana said that there's an event in the mall nearby...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_8@I'm so glad that Zumi is inviting me! How about we get prepared and set out after half an hour?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P090_N_2_9@Sure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_10@What...? I thought I'd already woken sister up before coming to wake you...\nDid she go back for a cat nap?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_11@Hey! Go wake her up again for me!\nI still have to prepare breakfast for the other members.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_12@Is it so hard to say "please?" And people wonder who is the more mature person?...\nWhat a rude girl...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_13@Hey~ Yiliy~ You there?\nI'm coming in~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_14@Hm...? She's not here... Where could she be...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_16@Wait... What? Tomoka, why are you here...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_17@... Hm...?\nAhh... Good morning~ Coach~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_18@Don't you "good morning" me now... Do you know where you are?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_19@Not the time for "Good morning"...? Do I know where I am...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_20@Could it be...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_21@It's already midnight and I'm sleeping on Coach's bed!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_22@Fair enough... Why did I expect you to know the correct answer...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_23@It's morning right now... but this is Yiliy's room. \nWhat are you doing sleeping here...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_24@Oh~ So this isn't my room... I better get back to my room to continue sleeping then... Good night...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_25@Wait... Don't go back to sleep! Tomoka! Get back here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_26@Alright, so this is Tomoka's room!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_27@Tomoka! Rise and shine! Wake up! Training awaits!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_29@Y-Yiliy...? Why are you here...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_3@Stupid player! Shouldn't you be used to it already?!\nWhy do you still look so terrified whenever I wake you up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_30@... Hm...?\nAhh... Good morning~ player~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_33@Ahh~ I know. It's already midnight and I fell asleep on player's bed?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_34@Indeed, you would often fall asleep in my bed... but right now it's already morning and you're sleeping in Tomoka's room. Wait... why am I getting a sense of déjà vu...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_35@So, where is Tomoka?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_36@She's sleeping right next to me... Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_37@So... this isn't my room... I guess I'll head back to my room to continue sleeping... Good night...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_38@Cut it off! Both of you!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_4@Because... Who in their right mind wakes someone up so loudly...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_5@If possible, could you wake me up more gently?\nIt would be even better if you could pat me on my shoulder or pick me up and put me down onto the couch...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_6@What are you talking about? Are you a kid or something...?\nWake up right now! I don't have time for your sleep talking!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_7@You're so mean... Zumi.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_1_9@Hm? Am I the first one to wake up today?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_10@Phew~ I'm finally done cleaning the kitchen... Now on to the living room...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_11@Ahh... I really don't want to face this mess... A bunch of girls were walking around while eating and bumping into each other... some clumsy members that woke up late even spilled stuff...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_12@It will take forever tidying this up... How am I gonna prepare lunch at this rate...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_13@…♪
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_14@Sis... Do you have any plans for the morning?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_15@Oh~ I'm going to make myself a cup of coffee and finish this novel I'm reading...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_16@Don't you think you're living a bit too relaxed, sis...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_17@Hehe~ You know what?\nMy biggest dream is...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_18@I know~ "Have barbeque for dinner and then take a nice hot bath! My life would be complete!"
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_19@Eh? How do you know what I wanted to say...\nCould it be... the incredible connection between sist...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_2@Okay. We're ready for morning training! Zumi, could you help tidy up?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_20@No... It's just that you've said this before so many times already..
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_22@─14:00 p.m.─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_24@Well... Sis is still drinking coffee and reading... Really now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_25@But... hehe~ I'm the only one who knows how good she is to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_26@～～♪
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_27@Hmm... Even Tomaka is there with her. One of them is reading a book, while the other is listening to music... \nThose two really are pretty similar in regards to personality...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_28@... Wait a second...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_29@To-Tomoka? Ms. Tomoka! Why are you still here?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_3@Humph... Stupid player is only good at asking people for favors!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_30@Me...? I'm listening to music~ Do you want to listen too?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_31@No! I'm not asking about that!\nHasn't the afternoon training already begun?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_32@Ahh~ About that... That's because~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_33@I overslept and completely forgot about the time~ Good thing Coach didn't find out~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_34@After all, it's way too hard getting up in this nice weather, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_35@I totally agree!\nThis wonderful weather would go to waste if we aren't able to do whatever we like!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_36@So that's how it is... Ha... Haha...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_37@Who said I wouldn't find out?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_38@Waaaahh~ C-Coach!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_39@Tomoka! How dare you oversleep and skip the training...\nYou'll be making up for it by doing both morning and afternoon training! Just you wait and see!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_4@Take care~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_40@Aaaah~ Yiliy~ Heeeeelp~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_5@Sigh... Stupid player is so busy right off the bat... Can his body really handle it...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_6@Hehe~ Zumi, you worry too much~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_7@It's not like that! I'm not worrying about him!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_2_9@─7:30 a.m.─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_1@─14:20 p.m.─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_10@─8 hours ago, 6:00 a.m.─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_11@I should go wake Yiliy and stupid player up... \nIf I recall correctly, today is the first day of morning training...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_12@I bet this doofus will oversleep...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_13@Ah~ Good morning, Zumi~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_14@Eh? Why is sis up so early today?\nAnd you're coming out from stupid player's room! Did something happen?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_15@Hehe~ That's a secret~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_17@Aaaaaahh──!\nI woke up too late! There's only thirty minutes left before the morning training!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_18@Clothes! Where are my clothes?!\nOh! Here!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_19@But... Why are they folded so neatly? And there are also clothes to change into after training?!\nAnd... the training plan is all organized here... Could it be an elf...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_20@Stupid player! Stop yelling! You're so noisy!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_21@Zumi... Is that you...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_22@You're not making any sense \nIf you're ready then come downstairs for breakfast already!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_23@O... Okay...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_24@So... who on earth prepared all this for me...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_28@─3 hours ago, 11:00 a.m.─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_29@Hmmm... Stupid player should be back in an hour. Fried eggs, pickled radish, grilled zucchini, and miso soup are ready... So only the main dish is left...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_3@Hey~ player~ Don't be so harsh on her~\nIt's also important to get proper rest...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_30@I remember there are some thawed chicken in the fridge... How about making teriyaki chicken...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_31@Chicken... Chicken... No... It's not in the fridge...\nDid I... forget to thaw it?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_32@Eh... There's a sticky note here...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_33@"I saw some chicken in the freezer and remembered you saying yesterday that it was the main dish for today and forbade me from eating it. You seemed to have forgotten to take it out from the freezer."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_34@"I've already thawed it in the microwave. It's also been marinaded and is resting over in the spice zone so you can cook it directly. Last but not least, I've put your favorite pudding in the fridge. Thank you for everything you've done for us, Zumi."
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_35@Sis... You doofus...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_36@─14:25 p.m.─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_39@Stupid player... You've never seen things from Yiliy's perspective and seen what she has done for the team... \nI think you'd better apologize to her...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_4@Sis... I don't think Tomoka is having proper rest.. but excessive rest...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_40@What? Did I say anything wrong?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_41@At six this morning, I saw sis coming out from your room...\nThat muddlehead who oversleeps everyday remembered that you have morning training today.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_42@She woke up early to help you prepare everything you needed... And she was too afraid to wake you up so she had to do it sneakily.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_43@Re-Really?! So it was Yiliy...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_45@And... Sis... Thank you so much for preparing the ingredients for lunch... and the dessert for me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_46@No problem...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_47@Yiliy... Sorry... I didn't know any of this, and yet I still said things like that to you...\nI was able to start the morning training on time all thanks to you... Thank you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_48@Don't mention it... I'm glad that I could be of assistance. \nBecause you two are the people I love most in the world...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_49@It remained the same ever since we were little... I'll look after you two in my own way...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_5@Zumi is right, Yiliy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_6@Even though you're not a member of the team yet, I still think you're too indifferent about the life here from what I've seen.\nJust look at Zumi, who isn't a member either, but she still helps everyone with chores.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_7@She has been very helpful to all the members and to me as well... \nI hope you understand what I mean...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_8@Of course I do. Don't worry~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_3_9@(I've known it all along... So I'll protect all of you... in my own way.)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_1@Stupid player~! It's already six thirty!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_11@Y-Yiliy!!\nWhy are you... in my bed?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_12@Ah... Why am I sleeping here...? So I'm not sleeping in my room again...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_13@T-That means the pillow I was lying on...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_14@Yes... You were lying on my breasts...♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_15@S-Sorry! I'll get out now!!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_16@It's okay~ It's comfortable after all...\nplayer, don't you want some more sleep? We haven't slept together since we grew up...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_17@No... That's ok...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_18@I really don't mind at all... as long as I can do comfortable stuff with player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_19@Hey~! Stupid player! Are you up yet?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_2@Uhm... Thank you... Zumi...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_20@C-Crap! Zumi's outside!\nShe must not know Yiliy was sleeping with me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_21@I... I'm up already!! I'll come out right now!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_22@Breakfast is ready! Hurry up and come downstairs~\nTell me if you have anything in mind for lunch so I can prepare it in advance.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_23@Well... Carbonara would be great!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_24@Phew...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_25@Hehe~ It's so funny to see player being so nervous...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_26@Yiliy... It's not funny at all...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_27@Actually... I really hope player can feel something for me...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_28@Hm? What was that?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_29@Hehe~ No, nothing~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_3@I feel so heavy... like I'm sinking into a soft pillow...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_30@After all, I can't make player mine before Zumi does... Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_31@─12 hours later─
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_32@Hm... Why am I... waking up in a place I don't know...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_37@Hmm...? This sounds like... player and Zumi?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_38@Um... Uhm...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_39@Dummy... You can't... ki-kiss...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_40@Zumi... You look just so... adorable now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_41@D-Doofus...! What... what are you talking about...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_42@When did these two became so close to each other?\nCould it be because of the quarrel at noon...? Hehe~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_43@Sis can't know that... we've been doing things like this...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_44@Yiliy? We are a family after all... even though we're not blood-related...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_45@That's not the reason... It's because Yiliy has always liked player a lot, too...\nI don't want to upset her... by making the first move...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_46@Zumi is so adorable... I won't be upset...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_47@S-Sis...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_48@Yiliy...? Why are you... \nAre you still groggy from a nap?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_49@Hehe~ It might be destiny... or it could be my inner desire... \nBut I always find myself drifting to player's room...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_5@Hm...? Is that my cellphone...? Why is there such a strange sound...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_50@But no matter what, tonight we should be together just like a family. No one is upsetting anyone.\nNothing matters as long as I am with Zumi and you, since you are both my favorite family members.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_6@Pillow... So warm and soft...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_8@Well... this soft texture, floral fragrance... and this familiar voice...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_4_9@player...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_1@Training... is too much... I can't...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_10@Hehe, she seems to be sleeping well. Great.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_11@Yiliy gets back to her reading on the same couch with Tomoka.\nAs the sunlight slowly tilts, Yiliy's body also slowly tilts and eventually leans against Tomoka.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_12@Phew... I'm sleepy, too... Zzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_14@We're home~~ Eh? That's...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_16@After noticing who are on the couch, Akane, who has just arrived home, puts her finger on her lips and smiles at Nadeshiko, who's standing behind her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_17@Shh── Do not wake them up.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_2@Just when Tomoka steps into the dorm, she was staggering unsteadily.\nAfter she finally manages to stumble into the living room, she collapses on the couch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_3@I'm exhausted... Zzzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_4@Tomoka falls asleep deeply. After a while, some soft footfalls approach.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_5@Tomoka? Why are you sleeping here?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_6@Zzzz... Zzzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_7@Sigh, look how sweaty you are. You'll get a cold this way.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_8@Yiliy puts down the book in her hands, brings a towel to gently wipe off the sweat on Tomoka, and takes a blanket to cover her belly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_1_9@Ugh... Zzz...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_1@It's breezy at 3 p.m., and the angle of the sunlight is just perfect for reading.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_10@You didn't. Don't mind me. I'm fine...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_11@Yiliy... You'll spoil everyone if you're fine with anything.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_12@Hmm... But I genuinely feel fine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_13@When I was living with player and Zumi, they fought a lot, so our home was always lively.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_14@After Zumi and I went to study abroad with player staying in Star City, our life suddenly became so quiet...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_15@... And that made me feel... a bit lonely.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_16@Therefore, I like how the team is right now. So you don't have to apologize to me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_17@Everyone is fighting for a goal together while living a lively life... It's my ideal family life.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_2@Yiliy sits by the window with a cup of freshly brewed tea. However, right before she opens the book, a yell tears the serene afternoon apart.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_3@Give it back to me, Rina!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_4@Hehe, first come first serve~ I've got the last pudding!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_5@You do this all the time! I hate you! Pudding hacker!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_6@Heehee~~~
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_7@Rina dashes into the yard. After noticing Yiliy, Yui stops with surprise.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_8@Sorry. We didn't know you were here... Did we bother your reading?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P091_N_2_9@With a slight smile, Yiliy shakes her head.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_14@—Why don’t I pretend to be possessed and have some fun?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_17@Oh! H-Has it arrived?! Is it a fierce demon? Or is it a demon lord?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_18@I don’t bother to reply to Alice. Instead, I rip off her clothes roughly to expose her milky breasts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_19@Ah!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_20@Oh no! It’s going on a rampage! Will I have to use my body to calm it down...?!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_21@As expected of Alice, she understood the situation immediately. Then I won’t hold back!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_22@As if I really was filled with a mysterious power, my cock becomes stiff quickly and pokes against Alice’s pussy.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_23@Aahh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_24@Alice’s body trembles as she feels my hot rod against her. Instead of looking scared, she actually seems to be trembling with pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_25@Urgh... I’m not feeling good at all... A witch will never lose to a demon...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_26@Alice murmurs to herself as she tries to control her thoughts, but her whole body shakes when the top of my cock kisses her clitoris.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_27@Haa... Not there... Coach, wake up...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_28@Now that I've been possessed by a tyrannical and lusty demon, there’s no way I will stop just because Alice wants me to.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_29@I press my cock against her snatch and rub her pussy from the lips to her clitoris repeatedly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_30@Her pussy feels so soft and alluring. I can feel the tip of my cock become lubricated as I secrete pre-cum which I rub all over Alice’s pussy like I'm marking it as mine.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_31@(Cock... It’s become so big... It’s so hard and hot... How amazingly aggressive... I... It feels so good...)
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_32@Alice loses herself in the pleasure and starts craving my cock. The love juice that drips out of her pussy starts making squelching noises as my cock rubs against it.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_34@Alice becomes delirious with lust and can’t stop herself from moaning as her clitoris becomes engorged. If I stick it in now...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_35@I thrust my hips hard upward as Alice’s body sinks down and manage to stick my cock deep inside her with one thrust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_36@It’s in me! The demon’s cock is inside me!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_37@Alice makes a moan that sounds like a pitiful cry as her body arches back. If I didn't grab her in time, I wouldn’t be surprised if she arches all the way back.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_38@But now that she’s been imprisoned by a “demon”, she can't do anything other than accept her fate as she is violated.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_39@Holding back the pleasure and shame of being violated, Alice shouts with tears in her eyes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_40@That’s enough already. Listen to my commands...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_41@*Whoosh* My response to her is a rough thrust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_42@Aaaaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_43@I don’t know if Alice understands or not, but her pussy has an unbelievable talent—it is reacting well to being fucked so roughly and her walls are sucking tight on my cock.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_44@I’m happy to play the part of an out of control demon so I fuck her fast and hard.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_46@Would I have to wait until it cums to control it...? What demon is this... No... I’m going to lose...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_47@As my cock rubs all along the insides of her pussy, her pussy seems to become soft as it surrenders.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_48@Her pussy is actually feeling so good even in this situation... Hehe, I can’t possibly be the only one to think that.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_50@My cock pounds her cock heavily and fiercely, making loud noises.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_51@Alice’s defenses are torn down by the barrage of thrusts and she starts to cry.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_53@She her unrestrained sobbing actually teases me more than anything else at this moment. As I feel myself about to cum, I ready myself for one last round of thrusts.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_55@Alice is so excited that her nipples are standing tall and firm. Even the demon’s restraint can't stop her body from clenching tight as pleasure surges through her body.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_56@Her pussy squeezes my cock tightly all of a sudden, a feeling that is simply irresistible—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_58@As my cock explodes with white semen, Alice screams as she climaxes.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_59@After pleasure overloads our brains at the same time, we find ourselves panting powerlessly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_61@Although Alice is in a daze and looks like she is about to faint, she is still concerned about one thing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P10_h3_62@Has the demon left...?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_1@I agreed to have dinner with Misako at her home.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_14@Under the table, Misako’s has extended her leg so that she can rub the sole of her foot against my crotch.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_16@I do my best to pretend nothing is happening as I watch Misako and her husband get along in front of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_17@Hehe...♥
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_2@But I don't feel relaxed at all because—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_21@Misako speaks apologetically as she finds a blanket for her husband... Meanwhile, her luscious ass sways left and right in front of me.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_22@I pull Misako close and stick my rock-hard cock against her delicious ass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_23@Ahh... Coach, my husband is right in front of us...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_24@Although Misako says that, she doesn’t have any intention to reject me. As my cock rubs against her, Misako’s fragile reservations crumble.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_26@Misako starts moaning hungrily as she savors the firmness and heat of my cock, and sways her ass in sync with my movements.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_27@You’re actually rubbing yourself against another man’s cock in front of your husband. You must really want this cock, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_28@It’s because I need to take good care of our guest... And look at you, your cock is already so big.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_29@Misako looks at me with undisguised provocation and desire... Or I should say that she is looking at my cock lodged in her ass.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_30@I don’t think it’s easy to calm down in this situation? I must clean it up for you...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_31@Yes, this is part of being a good host.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_32@I lift Misako’s one-piece sweater to find that this model wife is actually completely naked underneath. Her plump pussy is fully exposed to me and I can see that she is dripping wet.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_33@—I’m going to help myself then!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_34@I plunge my cock deep inside her pussy with one hard thrust that pushes Misako’s breasts out of her sweater where they dangle erotically.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_35@Ahh— This is it...! This is it! Ahhhhh! It’s filling me up!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_36@Misako screams loudly, her face contorted with pleasure. Meanwhile, her sleeping husband who is completely unaware is right in front of her.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_37@Hey, it isn't that good to be that excited in front of your husband, right?
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_38@Although that’s what we say, neither of us want to stop our erotic play.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_39@I thrust my hips powerfully, making erotic squishy noises with each thrust.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_4@—Misako’s husband is one of the directors of the League, which means he is the boss of my boss... I feel so stressed about this dinner.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_40@I’m sorry, dear... But this just feels too good... Ahhhhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_41@Misako’ apologizes to her husband even as her body seems to enjoy the intense pleasure. Misako’s husband is right next to us as we fuck furiously like animals in heat.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_42@It’s as if we are both in a frenzy because we know how immoral we are acting and our excitement and pleasure is intensified by this feeling.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_43@Sex feels so good... I love sex so much but he won’t do it with me at all... Aaaahhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_44@My cock drills deep inside the pussy of this sexy milf again and again from behind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_45@Misako’s giant breasts jiggle non-stop from our passionate movements and her pussy is clenched tight. Even so, Misako keeps screaming out loud for more.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_47@I want more cocks! Aaaaahhhhhhhh!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_48@Looking at Misako’s wild lust makes me forget about holding back. All I want right now is to pump this slutty pussy and fill it with my cum.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_49@My thrusts become faster and heavier as lust fills my mind.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_50@Give me all your semen—
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_51@Misako screams again and lifts her ass up higher so my cock can reach even deeper. At the same time, it clenches my cock tightly.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_52@Nghh, I'm about to cum!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_53@Her hungry pussy overpowers my cock. With a low growl, I thrust my hips one more time.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_55@Misako climaxes at the same time I shoot my load inside her, and her body spasms with pleasure.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_56@My cock twitches again and again, forcing out semen every time, until her pussy is filled up completely with my semen.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_57@Aaahhhh...!
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_58@Misako collapses next to her sleeping husband from the intense feeling of climaxing.
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_59@She looks at her sleeping husband’s face in a stupor, but her mind is filled with something else...
T_Dialog_Dialog_P11_h3_60@Thoughts of hot cum...
